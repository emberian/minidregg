# the mini shellserver: a guide for friends (from ember)

**beta, read this first.** i will reset the store at least once this week (a data-model
cutover) and a few more times before Oct 13 (kernel wire changes). when i reset it, your
ssh key and your signing key stay, and everything you made goes: resources, grants,
history. i'll tell you before each one. after a reset i enroll you again, and you redo
your first 10 minutes.

**key custody.** your dregg signing key is made *on the box*, inside your session home,
and i'm root there, so i can read it. enrollment also needs a copy in my session for a
moment (the shell co-signs with both keys; a later step removes that). don't put
anything precious behind it yet. taking your key home to your own machine is planned.

## what this is

mini is a small store of owned resources. every action is a signed request the Host
(written in Lean) admits or refuses; admitted ones leave a receipt. you use it through
`mini shell` over ssh: one verb = one client operation, and a no always says why.

## getting in

1. make an ssh key just for this: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/mini`
2. send me `~/.ssh/mini.pub` (the `.pub` one, only that) and the name you want for your
   session (lowercase letters, digits and `-`; it's permanent).
3. when i say you're on the list: `ssh -t -i ~/.ssh/mini mini@2.28.141.27` (no DNS name yet).
   you land at `mini> `. Tab completes verbs and names, Up/Down walks history, `help`
   lists every verb, and `help VERB` shows what it runs.

```
ssh -t -i ~/.ssh/mini mini@2.28.141.27                 # interactive
ssh -i ~/.ssh/mini mini@2.28.141.27 'read notes'       # one verb; exit code is the verb's
ssh -T -i ~/.ssh/mini mini@2.28.141.27 < steps.mini    # a script, one verb per line, stops at the first failure
```

## your first 10 minutes

```
mini> keygen mini.key            # your signing key, in your session home; then tell me "done"
   … i enroll you and give you a factory grant and a small funded account.
     i send you your subject number (a long decimal) …
mini> init mini.key SUBJECT      # your workspace; before i've provisioned you it says so and makes nothing
mini> whoami                     # "initialized": true, "subject": "<yours>"
mini> create notes declared {"type":"all","predicates":[]}
                                 # a resource of your own, under a permit-all law
                                 # → "type": "confirmed", "confirmation": "installed"
mini> invoke first notes create 2 1     # propose: set field 2 to 1 (nothing is sent yet)
mini> submit first                      # send it → installed
mini> read notes                        # the page now has field 2 = 1
mini> invoke second notes write 2 7 1   # write 7 where you expect 1 now
mini> submit second
```
give a friend a narrower grant (they tell you their subject from `whoami`):
```
mini> delegate give-sam notes SAMS-SUBJECT observe,mutate 50000
mini> submit give-sam
mini> publish give-sam
```
hand the reference over (it's JSON addressed to sam):
```
you$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/mini mini@2.28.141.27 'export give-sam' > give-sam.json   # send them this file
sam$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/mini mini@2.28.141.27 "import notes $(cat give-sam.json)"
sam$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/mini mini@2.28.141.27 'read notes'
```
retrying is safe. after i restart the service, the same attempt returns the same receipt:
```
mini> retry first                # "confirmation": "replayed", same transactionId as before
```
laws. you can change the law and grants keep working:
`law v2 notes {"type":"not","predicate":{"type":"any","predicates":[]}}`, then `submit v2`.
this one still permits everything, and sam can still write. now lock it:
```
mini> law lock notes {"type":"any","predicates":[]}    # "any of nothing": denies everything
mini> submit lock
mini> read notes                                       # refused: law-denied: …   (exit 3)
mini> law unlock notes {"type":"all","predicates":[]}  # refused: law-denied: …
```
that's the point: nobody can bypass it, not you as owner and not me. **a lock is
permanent**, so lock throwaway things. `history` lists what you did and how each attempt ended.
take a grant back with `revoke cut notes SAMS-SUBJECT`, then `submit cut`; sam's next read
is `refused: revoked`.

documents. a doc is a resource whose lines you append and edit together:
```
mini> doc new paper                       # (or `doc new log note`: append-only, edits refused)
mini> doc append p1 paper 'first paragraph'
mini> submit p1
mini> doc show paper                      # numbered lines, who created each
mini> doc edit p2 paper 1 'first paragraph, better'
mini> submit p2                           # refused if someone changed line 1 since your `doc show`
mini> doc link p3 index paper             # a link from index to paper; `doc backlinks paper` finds it
mini> board new tasks                     # tasks 0 and 1: `board add`, `board take`, `board move … todo doing`
```
share a doc the same way as `notes` (delegate, publish, export/import). a page holds 16
entries (lines and links), so docs are short for now.

rooms. a room is a resource that other things are born *in*; holding a grant under the
room reaches the room and everything in it. the five verbs you'll use:
```
mini> room new lab                         # a workroom you found (`--template social`, or
                                           #   `--template realm` where only you place things)
mini> room invite i1 lab SAMS-SUBJECT      # one grant under lab: observe + place (add things)
mini> submit i1                            #   widen with --verbs observe,place,mutate,delegate;
mini> publish i1                           #   narrow with --fields 1,2 or --max-delta 7=50
mini> export i1                            # → the reference; sam runs `import lab <it>`
sam> doc new notes --in lab                # sam adds a doc to the room (so does `create … --in lab`)
mini> room members lab                     # who holds a standing grant under lab
mini> room kick k1 lab SAMS-SUBJECT        # then `submit k1`: sam's grant, and every grant sam
                                           #   handed on from it, is refused `revoked`
```
also `room list` (your rooms), `room law lab` (its current law). someone with no grant
under lab can't add anything to it: they get `refused: … notRoomMember`. the room's law
decides who may add things: changing it never revokes anyone's grant (the J7 rule), but a
law like `any [ not (verb == place), subject in {YOU} ]` stops everyone else adding
(`birthRefused`), while their reads keep working.

**leaving a room is yours to do; nobody has to kick you.** `room leave l1 lab`, then
`submit l1`: you give up your grant under lab, signed with your own key, and no one else's
permission is asked. everything you handed on from that grant ends with it (the leave says
which: `ended with it: …`), so if you invited someone with it, they're out too. after that
your reads of lab are refused `revoked` and you can't add to it. it's permanent: leaving
twice is refused `alreadyRevoked`, and coming back means the founder invites you again, which
is a new grant. the same verb works for any grant you hold, room or not: `renounce r1 REF`
(or `renounce r1 CAPABILITY-NUMBER [object|account|program]`), then `submit r1`. you can only
give up what's yours: renouncing someone else's grant is refused `notHolder`, and it tells
you nothing about theirs. an agent you run (Hermes) gives up a grant it was handed the same
way; giving up authority never needs `--i-know`.

## how things end

stdout is the answer. when a verb fails, stderr's last line starts with who decided:

| exit | first word | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | | done |
| 1 | `error:` | the client stopped; the Host wasn't asked or didn't answer |
| 2 | `usage:` | the line didn't parse (`help VERB`) |
| 3 | `refused:` | the Host said no, and says why (below) |
| 4 | `undecided:` | the Host didn't settle it; `lookup ID` asks again |

the reason after `refused:`:
- `no-grant`: nothing you hold covers that resource and that operation.
- `unknown-key`: this key isn't enrolled (yet, or since the last reset).
- `law-denied`: the resource's current law says no (see the lock above).
- `revoked`: the grant you used, or one it came from, was revoked.
- `stale-root`: you signed against a state that has since moved; do it again.
- `bad-signature`: the signature didn't verify for that key and that exact request.
- `malformed`: the request didn't decode, or didn't fit its operation.
- `undisclosed`: a refusal before you proved who you are, so on purpose it names nothing.

(rarer ones exist too, like `outside-validity`. refused frames are kept under `refusals/`.)

## what not to expect yet

- numbered fields, one scalar action per `invoke`, laws as JSON. no chat or paying
  yet; docs have no annotations or quotes yet. no uptime promises. IDs are write-once:
  pick a new one per request. `help guide` prints this guide.

## reaching me

telegram @emberian, or ember@lunar.town. paste the whole `refused:`/`error:` block,
because it holds the Host's own decoding.

## what's planned

this is why you'd come back, with no dates promised: **streams** (chat) inside rooms, **laws in a one-line
grammar** instead of JSON, **Hermes in a room** (an agent that reads the room and does
small useful things), **paying with $DREGG** for a room's week (a few dollars), and
eventually **a MUD** built from the same pieces.

thank you for poking at it early. (｡◕‿◕｡)
