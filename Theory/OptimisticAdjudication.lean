# Theory.OptimisticAdjudication — "FIGHTABLE DISPROOF" AS A DIFFERENT OBJECT FROM "CHECKABLE PROOF".

Port of breadstuffs `metatheory/Metatheory/OptimisticAdjudication.lean` onto Mini's
`Theory/Disputation.lean`. Changes from the ancestor: namespaces (`Metatheory.*` →
`Minidregg.Theory.*`, `Dregg2.Laws` → `Minidregg.Theory`); Mini's `Frame` has no
`Alive` field, so `ChallengerGap.CF` drops it; `Frame.Prop'` is `Prop'` at the
`EpistemicConsensus` namespace; the axiom pins are `#guard_msgs` over `#print axioms`
with the ancestor's exact output. Every statement and proof is otherwise unchanged.

`Theory.Disputation` builds the witness-fibre reflector `R_witness`: a verdict is read off a
**positive discharging witness**, never off a vote, and it escapes the judgment-aggregation
impossibility (Arrow / List–Pettit) precisely by restricting to the **certifiable domain** — you only
adjudicate what admits a certificate. Its whole constructive character is that **it never infers from
an absence.**

An *optimistic* / naysayer settlement inverts that polarity: the verdict is upheld-by-silence and is
flipped by a **refutation** certificate, so it is decided by the ABSENCE of a certificate within a
window. This module is the honest account of what that swap costs. It does NOT claim optimistic
settlement is sound; it isolates exactly which obligations are free, which must be assumed, and it
PROVES the load-bearing assumption is not removable.

## The three regimes, named

| regime            | the verdict is                                    | Byzantine-proof?                      |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| validity proof    | `∃ w. Discharged` — a realizability fact          | yes (`byzantine_majority_cannot_uphold`) |
| **optimistic**    | **`¬∃` refutation OBSERVED in the window**        | **not a realizability fact at all**   |
| political/ballot  | an aggregation of assertions                      | no — Arrow / List–Pettit              |

The optimistic regime is genuinely a THIRD thing: it is not an aggregation, so the Arrow obstruction
does not apply to it; but it is not a realizability fact either, so `R_witness`'s Byzantine-proofness
does not transfer. This module gives it its own name rather than laundering it as either neighbour.

## What is proved here

* **§2 free half — `upheld_optimisticallyUpheld`.** If a claim genuinely holds, NO sound refutation can
  be observed, so the optimistic verdict never wrongly rejects an honest settlement. This direction is
  free from `refutes_sound` alone. It is the *safety-for-the-honest-prover* half and it costs nothing.
* **§3 costly half — `optimistic_sound`.** The converse needs TWO further obligations, both carried
  EXPLICITLY as hypotheses in the style of the apex's `hfri`, never silently discharged:
  `RefutationComplete` (every false claim admits *some* certificate) and `Actuated` (every certificate
  that exists is actually *observed* in the window).
* **§4 the floor is FALSE without `Actuated` — `optimistic_unsound_without_actuation`.** A concrete,
  fully-inhabited instance where the optimistic verdict UPHOLDS a claim that does NOT hold. Per
  `feedback-prove-the-floor-false`: a floor must be satisfiable and REFUTABLE but not provable. This is
  the refutation. `Actuated` is not a technical convenience — dropping it makes the statement false.
* **§5 the challenger-strength gap — `distKnows_honest_does_not_give_a_challenger`.** The natural
  epistemic reading of the naysayer obligation is *"if the claim is false, the honest group
  distributedly knows a refutation"* (`DistKnows F.Honest`). This section proves that obligation is
  **too weak**: a concrete frame in which the honest group distributedly knows `φ` while NO single
  honest agent knows it. A challenger must be one agent who can act, so the correct obligation is
  `∃ i, Honest i ∧ Knows i`, which is strictly stronger (`knows_imp_distKnows` runs one way only).

## The seam this module exists to make visible

`Actuated` is **not an epistemic fact and not a cryptographic one.** `Frame` has no time, no
scheduling, no message delivery — the gap between *"an honest agent could refute"* and *"an honest
agent will, in time"* is not expressible here at all. That gap is the entire trust delta of an
optimistic construction, which is why no amount of cryptographic engineering closes it. Stating it as
a carried hypothesis, and proving the theorem false without it, is the most this layer can honestly do.

⚠ HISTORY, read before extending: `Theory.Disputation`'s own header records that a four-lens
adversarial review refuted the previous headline in this exact conceptual neighbourhood **4/4** (the
`Predicate ⊣ Witness` adjunction thesis, `project-adjunction-thesis-verdict`). This area has already
produced one elegant falsehood. Nothing here should be cited as "optimistic settlement is sound".

`Theory.Searchable` pointedly has NO soundness field, so that adversarial prover plugins remain
legal instances — consumers re-`Verify` whatever `find` returns and never trust it. A refutation
checker cannot be treated that way: in an optimistic settlement the refutation is *acted upon*, so an
unsound checker lets a naysayer grief honest settlements with no recourse. The positive side can
afford untrusted search because the verdict re-checks; the negative side cannot, because the verdict
IS the check. -/

/-- **`RefutationComplete`** — every false claim admits *some* refutation certificate. This is a
property of the refutation SYSTEM (is the negative certificate expressive enough?), and it is a real
design obligation: a refutation language that cannot express some failure mode silently upgrades that
failure mode into an unchallengeable one. -/

⚑ This is the load-bearing assumption and it is **neither cryptographic nor epistemic**. `Frame`
carries no time, no scheduling and no message delivery, so this proposition cannot even be stated in
the epistemic layer, let alone discharged there. It is a synchrony/liveness assumption about the
deployment, and it is carried explicitly here — in the style of the apex's `hfri` — so that no
consumer can mistake it for something proved. §4 shows it is not removable. -/

Under both obligations, an unrefuted claim is **not-not** upheld. This is the whole constructive
content of optimistic settlement, and it costs **no axioms at all** (`#print axioms` reports none).

Everything the scheme actually establishes stops here. The step from `¬¬upheld` to `upheld` is

status is settled one way or the other, no classical principle is needed: the `¬¬` collapses.

/-- **`optimistic_sound` — the costly half, with both obligations visible in the type.**

⚑ **THIS IS THE ONE THEOREM IN THE MODULE THAT USES `Classical.choice`, AND THAT IS NOT AN ARTIFACT
OF HOW IT IS PROVED.** `upheld_optimisticallyUpheld` (the honest-prover direction) is axiom-free;
so are the §4 counterexample and the §5 separation. The classical step appears *here* and only here,
because *"nothing refuted it, therefore it holds"* **is double-negation elimination**. The
constructive core stops at `optimistic_gives_double_negation`; `Holds` is `∃ w : W, Discharged …`,
an existential over an arbitrary witness type, so it is not decidable in general and the collapse
cannot be earned back (`optimistic_sound_of_decided` shows exactly what would earn it).

So the induction/coinduction reading has a proof-theoretic twin, and the kernel checks it: a validity
proof is constructive; **an optimistic verdict is classical reasoning, deployed.** That is a precise,
machine-checked statement of what the polarity swap costs — and it is emphatically NOT a security
claim. `Classical.choice` is not an adversary; nobody steals a wallet with Hilbert choice. It is a
DIAGNOSTIC: its appearance in exactly one of these theorems tells you which regime you are in. -/

/-! # §3b. THE THIRD GAP — findability, and the fact that it does NOT rescue the logic

There are **three** distinct gaps between *"a refutation exists"* and *"the chain sees one"*, and §3
models only the outer two:

1. **existence** — `RefutationComplete`, a bare `∃ r, Refuted`. It may be a *classical* existential:
   true, with no algorithm attached.
2. **findability** — someone can actually COMPUTE the certificate. Modelled here.
3. **delivery** — `Actuated`. It reaches the chain inside the window.

Gap 2 is where a classically-proved `RefutationComplete` would bite hardest, and the bite is not a
security failure but a VACUITY: the safety argument goes through while nobody can construct the
challenge it promises. `Theory/Knowledge.lean` already has exactly the right shape on the positive side
(`Searchable`, an `Option`-valued untrusted plugin with no soundness field); this section supplies the
dual, and then records the negative result that closing gap 2 does NOT buy back the constructivity
that §3 lost. -/

/-- The **untrusted refutation searcher** — dual of `Theory.Searchable`, and deliberately
carrying **no soundness field**, for exactly the reason `Searchable` carries none: an adversarial or
broken searcher must remain a legal instance. Soundness is recovered by RE-CHECKING with `Refutes`,
never by trusting `findRefutation`. -/
class RefutationSearchable (P : Type u) (W : Type u) (R : Type u)
    [Verifiable P W] [Refutable P W R] where
  /-- Try to produce a refutation certificate. No completeness or termination promise. -/
  findRefutation : P → Option R

/-- **`searched_refutation_sound_when_checked` — the search result is irrelevant; the CHECK is
everything.** Note that `_hfound` is unused in the proof, and that is the content of the lemma: no
property of the searcher is needed, because the consumer re-`Refutes` whatever came back. This is the
`Searchable` discipline transported to the negative side. -/
theorem searched_refutation_sound_when_checked [RefutationSearchable P W R]
    (p : P) (r : R)
    (_hfound : RefutationSearchable.findRefutation (P := P) (W := W) (R := R) p = some r)
    (hchecked : Refuted (P := P) (W := W) p r) :
    ¬ ∃ w : W, Discharged (P := P) (W := W) p w :=
  Refutable.refutes_sound (W := W) p r hchecked

/-- **`RefutationEffective`** — constructive completeness: an actual FUNCTION producing the
certificate, not a bare existential. This is `Type`-valued because it is DATA. It is what an optimistic
scheme actually needs from its refutation system, and what a classical `RefutationComplete` proof does
not supply. -/
def RefutationEffective (X : Claim P) : Type u :=
  ¬ upheld (P := P) (W := W) X → {r : R // Refuted (P := P) (W := W) X.stmt r}

/-- Effectiveness implies existence. **One way only** — the converse is exactly the gap. -/

    (h : RefutationEffective (P := P) (W := W) (R := R) X) :
    RefutationComplete (P := P) (W := W) (R := R) X :=
  fun hno => ⟨(h hno).1, (h hno).2⟩

/-- **`optimistic_dne_effective` — closing gap 2 leaves the constructive core exactly where it was.**
With a genuine refutation ALGORITHM, an unrefuted claim is still only `¬¬upheld`, and this is still
axiom-free. Findability was never what the collapse needed. -/
theorem optimistic_dne_effective (X : Claim P) (observed : R → Prop)
    (heff : RefutationEffective (P := P) (W := W) (R := R) X)
    (hact : Actuated (P := P) (W := W) X observed)
    (hopt : optimisticallyUpheld (P := P) (W := W) X observed) :
    ¬¬ upheld (P := P) (W := W) X :=
  optimistic_gives_double_negation (W := W) X observed
    (refutationEffective_imp_complete (W := W) X heff) hact hopt

/-- **`optimistic_sound_effective` — and the collapse is STILL classical.**

⚑ THE NEGATIVE RESULT, and it is the point of §3b: an effective refuter does NOT restore
constructivity. The reason is structural, not incidental — `RefutationEffective` is a function OF
`¬ upheld X`, and the scheme never has `¬ upheld X`; it only ever has `¬¬ upheld X`. So the algorithm
can never be RUN by the soundness argument, however constructive the algorithm itself is.

Read `#print axioms` on this and on `optimistic_dne_effective` together: the three gaps are
INDEPENDENT. Closing findability buys a usable challenger and buys nothing logically. -/

/-! # §5. The challenger-strength gap — `DistKnows Honest` does not give you a challenger

The natural epistemic reading of the naysayer safety obligation is the dual of
`no_dist_knowledge_of_unrealizable`: *"if the claim is false, the honest group DISTRIBUTEDLY KNOWS a
refutation"* — `F.DistKnows F.Honest`. This section proves that reading is **too weak to be useful**.

Distributed knowledge is the group's POOLED perspective; it may be held by no individual. A challenger
in an optimistic scheme must be a single agent who can act. So the obligation an optimistic settlement
actually needs is `∃ i, F.Honest i ∧ F.Knows i`, and `knows_imp_distKnows` runs only in the unhelpful
direction. The frame below separates them with every agent HONEST, so the gap is not an artifact of
Byzantine agents — it is intrinsic to the modality. -/
