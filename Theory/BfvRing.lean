# Bfv.Ring — the noise model on the ACTUAL ring `R = ℤ[X]/(X^N+1)`.

**The gap this module closes.** `Bfv.Noise` models a ciphertext's phase as a SINGLE integer
(`Bfv.Ct.phase : ℤ`) and says so: "the lift to n = 4096 polynomial coefficients is NOT formalized —
that correspondence is a NAMED model gap". `Bfv.Mul` names the same gap harder: "the ring lift is
MISSING and multiplication makes it load-bearing … the lift itself (`‖a·b‖_∞ ≤ n·‖a‖_∞·‖b‖_∞` over
`R_q = Z_q[X]/(X^n+1)`) is Phase-2." This module IS that lift, for the additive/public-linear path.

## Which noise model is formalized here — say it plainly

**The WORST-CASE COEFFICIENT (ℓ∞) model, and only that.** Every bound below is a statement about
`max_k |coefficient k|` that holds for EVERY input, with no distributional hypothesis.

**The average-case / heuristic model is DELIBERATELY NOT FORMALIZED.** The commonly quoted ring
expansion factor `δ_R ≈ 2√N` is an *experimental* constant — HEIR's own source annotates it as an
"experimental result", and Gao–Zheng (2025/1036) attack exactly that heuristic for BFV's dependent
products. It is not a theorem and nothing here pretends it is one. What is proved here is the
provable constant, `δ_R = N` (`negaMul_normInf_le`) — and `negaMul_expansion_attained` proves that
constant is EXACTLY ATTAINED, so `δ_R = N` is not a lazy over-estimate either: it is tight.

## The carrier

`Rn N = Fin N → ℤ` — an element of `ℤ[X]/(X^N+1)` in its DEPLOYED representation, the `N`
coefficients. Integer coefficients, not `ZMod q`, for the same reason `Bfv.Noise` works in `ℤ`: the
noise analysis is an exact-integer argument and the mod-`q` correspondence is handled separately
(`Bfv.Noise.decryptPhase_add_q`, which now applies coefficientwise — the wrap argument is
per-coefficient and unchanged by this lift).

`negaMul` is NOT postulated to be the ring product; it is PROVED to be one. `negaMul_toPoly_dvd`
and `toPoly_negaMul_quotient` show the coefficient map `toPoly` carries `negaMul` to genuine
multiplication in Mathlib's `Polynomial ℤ ⧸ (X^N+1)`. Without that, `‖negaMul a b‖ ≤ N‖a‖‖b‖`
would be a theorem about an arbitrary bilinear operation wearing a ring's name.

## What is proved

  1. **`negaMul_toPoly_dvd` / `toPoly_negaMul_quotient` (THE ANCHOR)** — `negaMul` is multiplication
     in `ℤ[X]/(X^N+1)`. `toPoly_add` does the same for `+`, discharging the "additions are
     coefficient-wise, so every statement lifts pointwise" claim `Bfv.Noise` left unformalized.
  2. **`negaMul_normInf_le` (THE ONE NEW RING FACT)** — `‖a·b‖_∞ ≤ N·‖a‖_∞·‖b‖_∞`. The provable
     worst-case expansion, `δ_R = N`.
  3. **`negaMul_expansion_attained` (TEETH, general in N)** — with `a = b = 1 + X + ⋯ + X^(N−1)`
     (so `‖a‖_∞ = ‖b‖_∞ = 1`), the `(N−1)`-th coefficient of `a·b` is EXACTLY `N`. The bound is
     attained at every degree, so no constant below `N` is sound;
     `negaMul_expansion_not_below_N` states that as a refutation.
  4. **THE PORT.** `matVecRCt` / `RowBound` / `stepR_noise_le` / `iterR_noise_le` — the
     `Bfv.Noise` public-linear-step theorems on the ring carrier. `RowBound` is not re-stated: this
     module IMPORTS and reuses `Bfv.RowBound` verbatim, because the row-sum hypothesis is about the
     integer matrix `S` and the carrier change does not touch it. **The row-sum bound survives with
     NO ring expansion factor** (`stepR_noise_le` concludes `G·M`, not `N·G·M`) — this is the
     coefficient-encoded / LZ–Bae matmul route's noise statement, and the reason that route is the
     one that closes under a bound we can prove.
  5. **`scalarMul_noise_le` vs `negaMul_normInf_le` (the price of a polynomial multiplier)** — an
     INTEGER scalar multiplier costs `|c|`; a PLAINTEXT-POLYNOMIAL multiplier costs `N·‖p‖_∞`.
     `polyStep_costs_expansion` pins the gap at the deployed `N = 4096`.
  6. **`stepR_rowBound_necessary` (TEETH)** — drop the row bound and the step conclusion is FALSE.
     The hypothesis is a constraint, not decoration.

## What is NOT claimed

  * Nothing here says the deployed Rust enforces any of this; these are the theorems the emitted
    constants would make enforceable, as everywhere in `Bfv/`.
  * `negaMul` is proved to be the ring product; it is NOT proved to be a `CommRing` instance
    (associativity/commutativity are inherited facts about the quotient, not re-proved here).
  * The mod-`q` reduction is still the named `Bfv.Noise` correspondence, now read coefficientwise.
    Ring MULTIPLICATION of two CIPHERTEXTS is `Bfv.Mul`'s scalar model still — this module lifts
    the additive/public-linear path and the plaintext-multiplier expansion factor, not the
    ct×ct tensor step.
  * Lattice security (class B) is not a Lean theorem here or anywhere in `Bfv/`.

Pure. No axioms beyond the kernel triple.
