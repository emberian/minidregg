/- Collection of the Core4 demand heap at a yield (design B4/T5).

A yielded activity's checkpoint is its exact machine state, and the demand machine
only ever allocates: every cell a finished demand left behind stays in the heap, so an
activity that loops through yields grows its checkpoint without bound. `collect` keeps
exactly the cells traced from the roots (the control, including the yielded Plan cell,
and every stack frame), compacts them in increasing old-address order, and renames
every address. Addresses past the heap (never present in a lexically valid state) are
renamed by the shift that keeps them past the compacted heap, so collection is total and
its behaviour theorem needs no validity premise.

Costs: marking is a worklist over an `Array Bool` (each cell is traced once, each edge
pushed once), ranking is one `Array.foldl`, compaction one `Array.zip`/`filterMap`, and
renaming touches each kept address once: linear in heap + edges, no list lookups over the
heap.

The behaviour theorem (a renaming simulation: lockstep `stepRaw`, `resume`, bounded runs,
Plan/result extraction) and the typing transfer are in
`Theory.ObjectiveBendDemandCollectProofs` (`ObjectiveProofs`). -/

/-! ## Settling: a cached cell's origin is no longer a root

A cached cell keeps the closure it was forced from (`Cell.cached origin value`). The
machine never reads it again: entering a cached cell returns its value, and only an
`evaluating` cell's origin is read (by its update frame). It is ghost data, kept by the
running machine because the source-correspondence proofs (`ObjectiveBendDemandAdequacy`)
name a cell's meaning by it. In a checkpoint it is worse than dead: `collect` traces it,
so a forced accumulator keeps alive every environment it was ever computed from (a
`tally` holds its whole history through its total's origin).

`settle` gives every cached cell the SELF origin `⟨.bound 0, [address]⟩` ("read this
cell"): it retains nothing but the cell itself, it is lexically valid wherever the cell
is, and it is typed at the cell's own assigned type, so a settled state is typed exactly
when the state was (`typed_settle`). Suspended and evaluating cells are untouched (their
origin is what they will run). Settling changes no transition (`settle_resume_segment`
in `Theory.ObjectiveBendDemandSettleProofs`: every bounded run, extraction and resume
agrees exactly, capacity suspensions included, because heap sizes are unchanged). -/

def settle (state : State) : State :=
  {state with heap := state.heap.mapIdx settleCell}

/-- What a yield stores: the settled state, collected. -/
def checkpoint (state : State) : State := collect (settle state)

/-- Limits counted from `start`'s own heap end: `limits.heap` cells beyond the heap it
starts with, and the same stack. A checkpoint resumes under these
(`Kernel.ObjectiveActivity.segmentLimits`): forcing and collection change the size of the
state a segment starts from, never the room it has past it. -/

/-! ## Measurement: collection drops garbage
