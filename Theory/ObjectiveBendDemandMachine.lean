/- Executable demand/sharing candidate for the NEW Objective Bend runtime core.
It consumes actual elaborated Objective terms, not a linked method dictionary.
Thunk identity is stable through evaluating→cached update; Fix uses one tied
heap address. All values here are effect-free: native authority and affine
continuations are not constructors and cannot be minted/copied by this machine.
Weak-head reference adequacy, graph/capture ownership and new type metatheory
remain obligations; old BendTT metatheory is not asserted for this edition. -/
