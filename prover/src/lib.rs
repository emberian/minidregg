//! minidregg-prover — UNVERIFIED COMPUTE downstream of the verified emit seam.
//!
//! Substrate, said out loud: this crate reads the `ConstraintDescriptor` that
//! `Compiler/Emit.lean` emits (whose faithfulness to the Lean AIR is the theorem
//! `emit_faithful`) and NEVER authors a constraint. There is no formal semantics of
//! Rust, so nothing in this crate is verification or refinement: the tests are
//! conformance vectors — cross-checks against facts the Lean side established
//! (`Compiler/EmitSerialize.lean`'s decided examples), kept honest by running, not
//! by proof. "The prover accepted" inherits the FRI/STARK floor (`[EMIT-sound]`).
//!
//! Rungs here: `[PROVER-serialize]` reader (descriptor.rs), `[PROVER-trace]`
//! (trace.rs). The commit/sumcheck/FRI/FS rungs and the adopted WGSL fold come
//! later, per docs/PROVER-PLAN.md.
