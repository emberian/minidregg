# Loom.SmallField — [OB-8]: the deployed-field reality — extension degree buys the bits.

Every soundness bound in the tower is `(numerator)/|F|` (Sumcheck's `v·d/|F|`, the
γ-fold's `(t−1)ℓ/|F|`, …). Those theorems are stated over an ABSTRACT field; the
DEPLOYED base field is small (BabyBear `p = 15·2²⁷ + 1 = 2013265921 ≈ 2³¹`), so
instantiating them at the base field yields ~25 bits of security at protocol-sized
numerators — nowhere near a λ = 100+ target — and at a genuinely small field the
bound exceeds 1 and constrains NOTHING. The standard deployment fix: sample the
verifier's challenges from a field EXTENSION `F_{q^k}`; the SAME theorems,
instantiated at the extension, give error `N/q^k` — the extension degree `k`
multiplies the security exponent. This file makes that dial rigorous. No new
probability is derived; the point is INSTANTIATION AT THE RIGHT FIELD, stated so
the deployed-security claim is legible (λ bits ⟺ `q^k ≥ N·2^λ`).

**What is proved here (no `sorry`, no vacuity):**

* `securityBits` — the bit-count of a soundness bound `N/Q`: `log₂(Q/N)`. Its
  calculus: `le_securityBits_iff` (λ bits ⟺ `N·2^λ ≤ Q`), `securityBits_lt_iff`
  (the failure direction), `err_le_inv_two_pow_iff` (the same fact at the error
  level, `N/Q ≤ 2^{−λ} ⟺ N·2^λ ≤ Q`), `securityBits_pow`
  (`securityBits N (q^k) = k·log₂ q − log₂ N` — the exponent is LINEAR in the
  extension degree), and the monotonicities `err_extension_le` (`N/q^k ≤ N/q`,
  the extension only shrinks the error) and `securityBits_mono_deg` (a higher
  extension degree never loses bits).
* `sumcheck_lambda_secure` — the landed `sumcheck_soundness` (≤ `v·d/|F|`,
  Loom/Sumcheck.lean) instantiated against a security target: if
  `v·d·2^λ ≤ |F|`, a false claim survives with probability ≤ `2^{−λ}`.
* `card_extension` + `sumcheck_lambda_secure_ext` — the deployed rendering:
  `|F_{q^k}| = q^k` (`Module.card_eq_pow_finrank` at the algebra structure), so
  the premise reads `v·d·2^λ ≤ q^k` — the base size `q` and extension degree `k`
  are the two dials, and `k` is the cheap one.
* The base/extension SEPARATION (§4): the prover's committed words live over the
  cheap base field, the verifier's challenges over the extension. `liftWordₗ` is
  the `F_q`-linear embedding of base words; `liftWord_mem_reedSolomonCode` — a
  base-field RS codeword lifts to an extension-field RS codeword at the SAME
  degree bound (`Polynomial.degree_map`); `fold_liftWord_mem` — the γ-fold with
  an EXTENSION challenge γ of base-committed codewords is again an extension
  codeword (the extension code is a `F_{q^k}`-module and base words land in it);
  `evalExtₗ` — evaluation of a base-committed polynomial at an extension
  challenge is `F_q`-linear, and agrees with mapping-then-evaluating.
* **Keystones, both poles built** (§5): satisfiable — at `|F| = 2³¹`, `N = 100`:
  between 24 and 25 bits (computed, both directions); at the degree-4 extension
  `2¹²⁴`: between 117 and 118 bits; at the REAL BabyBear prime `2013265921`:
  24–25 bits, and its degree-4 extension gives 116–117 — NOT the 117 the round
  `2³¹` suggests (quote the pessimistic number: the deployed prime loses the
  117th bit). Teeth — at `|F| = 5`, `N = 100` the "bound" `100/5 = 20 ≥ 1` is
  VACUOUS: `smallField_bound_vacuous` proves it for EVERY event with no
  soundness reasoning at all, and `smallField_bound_allows_certainty` exhibits
  the probability-ONE event satisfying it — zero security; `securityBits` is
  NEGATIVE there; and the SAME numerator at extension degree 60 clears λ = 128
  (`smallField_rescued_by_extension`) — the extension is load-bearing, not
  decoration. End-to-end: `sumcheck_lambda_secure` FIRES over F₅ (λ = 2, its
  ceiling: `smallField_lambda_ceiling` shows the λ = 3 premise is FALSE at the
  base) and over the genuine quadratic extension GF(25) at λ = 4
  (`sumcheck_lambda_secure_ext`, `GaloisField 5 2`, finrank = 2) — same
  numerator, same theorems, more bits; the accepting event is NONEMPTY
  (`acceptsFalse_witness`), so the secured bound constrains a real event.

**Honest residual [OB-8-tower] (prose, named realizer):** the binary-tower-field
specifics are NOT here — the tower embedding `F₂ ⊂ F₄ ⊂ … ⊂ F_{2^{2^ℓ}}` and its
packed arithmetic, sumcheck over towers à la Basefold/Binius, and WARP App. D's
base-change accounting (`|Λ(C_F,δ)| = |Λ(C_{𝔹^e},δ)|` transfers soundness but
costs O(λ) prover linearity — LOOM §5's stated open problem, the OB-8
contribution slot). Realizer: a tower-field instantiation of §4's algebra-map
machinery (`Algebra F₂ (towerField ℓ)` + the packing isomorphism) plus a
mechanized App. D transfer; the linearity-loss avoidance is open research. The
CORE — extension buys bits, small fields secure nothing — is proved above and
does not depend on the tower specifics.

`sumcheck_soundness` (Loom/Sumcheck.lean) is `≤ v·d/|F|` over an abstract
finite field. Here it meets the deployment inequality: a field with
`v·d·2^λ ≤ |F|` delivers λ bits. Nothing is re-derived — the calc chain is

/-- The cardinality of a finite field extension: `|K| = q^k` where `q` is the

extension degree `k`: `v·d·2^λ ≤ q^k`. The base field alone (`k = 1`) caps λ at
`log₂(q/(v·d))`; every further unit of `k` adds `log₂ q` bits. Same theorem,
instantiated at the right field. -/

/-! ## §4 The separation: base-field commitments, extension-field challenges

The prover's committed data is CHEAP — words over the base field `F_q`. The
verifier's randomness is SECURE — challenges in `F_{q^k}`. The two meet because
the base words embed `F_q`-linearly into the extension space, RS membership
survives the lift at the SAME degree bound, and the extension code is an
`F_{q^k}`-module — so a γ-fold with an extension challenge of base-committed
codewords is again a first-class extension-code claim. -/

/-! ## Audit note

The extension is genuinely load-bearing in the statements above, not decorative:
`smallField_bound_vacuous` derives the small-field "bound" from
`uniformProb_le_one` alone — no soundness content — and
`smallField_bound_allows_certainty` shows the probability-1 event satisfies it,
so F₅ at `N = 100` secures exactly nothing; `smallField_lambda_ceiling` is the
FALSE premise at the base field that `sumcheck_secure_ext`'s extension premise
(`16 ≤ 5²`) repairs with the same numerator and the same theorems. The
satisfiable pole is non-vacuous: `acceptsFalse_witness`/`…_ext` exhibit the
accepting event inhabited (the λ-bounds constrain a real event of probability
`1/5 > 0`), and every bit-count keystone is proved in BOTH directions (lower
AND upper bound), including the honest BabyBear degradation `116 ≤ bits < 117`
at degree 4 — the round `2³¹` estimate's 117th bit is NOT delivered by the
deployed prime.

`#print axioms` on every declaration in this file (`securityBits` through
`SmallFieldKeystone.acceptsFalse_witness_ext`): `propext`, `Classical.choice`,
`Quot.sound` — no `sorryAx`, no `native_decide`. -/
