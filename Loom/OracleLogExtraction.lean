# Loom.OracleLogExtraction — [ACC-rbr-bcs-shifted-resid](a) route (i): the
ORACLE-LOG vocabulary — straightline extraction that reads the prover's
random-oracle QUERY LOG.

`Loom/AccRbrBcsShifted.lean` built the fold-root carrier and named the residual
exactly: at the shifted round-`i+1` extension the FRESH challenge is INERT for
the fold data — the newly scorable increment `w_i = ρ_i⁻¹ • (h_{i+1} − h_i)` is
weighted by the ROUND-`i` challenge, already fixed when `h_{i+1}`'s root was
chosen — so Def 4.2's `uniformProb` over the fresh challenge cannot be priced
by the landed fixed-pair `accSound_rbr` event. Route (i) said: go OUTSIDE
`Reduction`'s oracle-free shape, to the BCS/ROM mechanism the deployment
actually uses — the prover derives every challenge by QUERYING the oracle, so
its QUERY LOG carries the temporal record `Reduction` erases. This file builds
that vocabulary and proves the parts of the route that close today.

What lands here:
* `OracleLog` (+ `answerOf`, the cons/nil laws, `answerOf_eq_none`) — the
  prover's query run as the extraction's input; NOT a mirror: the landed SR/FS
  game's trace IS an oracle log (`srTrace_answerOf`, citing
  `srHandlerRun_lookup`), and **the FS challenges ARE log reads**
  (`srFinalChal_eq_answerOf`, citing `srFinalChal_eq_lookup`). The fresh horn
  is a theorem: an UNQUERIED designated prefix gets its challenge from the
  output-independent fresh coin (`unqueried_chal_fresh`) — not querying
  forfeits grinding, and querying exposes the try to the log.
* `StraightlineOracleExtractor` / `OracleLogReduction` — the
  outside-`Reduction` objects: an extractor consuming ONLY (output, log) — no
  challenge-vector input, no rewinding — and a `Reduction` AUGMENTED with the
  ROM game and a log-only extractor at the `(t + k)·εlog` grinding price.
  Every inhabitant lands INSIDE the landed FS/SR statements
  (`OracleLogReduction.fs_sound` / `.sr_sound`, riding `fsStraightline_iff_sr`,
  CITED) — the same `(t + k)` error shape `fsKeystone_proved` proves and
  `lightClientGrinding_sound` deploys as `(t + n)`. The shape is inhabited
  (`trivialOracleLogReduction`), so the structure is not vacuous.
* `logIncrement` / `shiftedLogExtractor` — THE log extractor at the shifted
  BCS alphabet: read the log's ANSWER to the designated round-`i` prefix query
  (that is `ρ_i` — `srFinalChal_eq_answerOf`) and the two consecutive fold-root
  messages, return `ρ_i⁻¹ • (h_{i+1} − h_i)`. PROVED: on honestly-committed
  logs it recovers the increments EXACTLY (`logIncrement_recovers`, via
  `shifted_increment_recovered`, CITED — the seam's `γ⁻¹`-difference map now
  fired from the LOG's answer); it reads the log ONLY at the round-`i` query
  (`logIncrement_congr` — the shifted round event's fresh challenge is inert
  for the extracted witness, the residual's diagnosis now a THEOREM); and it
  genuinely needs the query (`logIncrement_none_of_unqueried` — no query, no
  witness; the log is load-bearing).
* `adaptiveIncrement_sound_via_log` — the target, STATEMENT-FIRST: an
  `OracleLogReduction` for `accReductionBcsShifted` whose extractor IS the
  log-read increment map wherever the log answers. NOT inhabited here;
  inhabiting it is the remaining mass, sharpened below to ONE named per-slot
  lemma `[ORACLE-LOG-program]` (`OracleLogProgram`, a formal `Prop`) plus
  named engineering.

**Keystones** (F₅, landed objects REUSED): `outF5`/`logF5` — a concrete
honest output and 3-entry query log on the landed shifted chain;
`log_recovers_F5` (satisfiable: the extractor reads `msEx` off the log,
`logIncrement_recovers` fired); `log_loadbearing_F5` (teeth: the EMPTY log
extracts nothing) + `log_wrong_answer_F5` (sharper teeth: a log answering the
round-0 query with `2` instead of `1` extracts `2⁻¹ • msEx 0 ≠ msEx 0` — the
ANSWER is load-bearing, not just the query's presence); `log_inert_F5` (the
inertness fired: changing the final — inert — query's answer moves nothing);
`adaptive_pins_extractor_F5` (the statement's clause has teeth: ANY inhabitant
must output `msEx` on the built log). No `sorry`, no vacuous `Prop := True`.

/-! ## The landed game IS a log: the bridges

The oracle-log route is only honest if "the log" is the LANDED game's object.
Three bridges, all cited into place: the trace's answers are the handler's
partial map, the FS challenges are log reads, and unqueried prefixes fall back
to fresh coins. -/

/-- **The game's trace, read as an `OracleLog`, denotes the landed handler's

`i` is the log's answer to the designated round-`i` prefix query, with the
fresh coin as fallback (`srFinalChal_eq_lookup`, CITED, through
`srTrace_answerOf`). This is the oracle-log route's ground fact: everything
the FS verifier derives, the prover's own query log already carries — an
extractor reading the log reads the SAME randomness the verifier uses. -/

/-- **The fresh horn — not querying forfeits grinding**: if the designated
round-`i` prefix is NOT in the log, the challenge the FS verifier uses is the
fresh coin `d i`, drawn AFTER the adversary's entire output is fixed. In
particular both fold roots `h_i, h_{i+1}` are output-fixed before the
challenge exists — exactly the fixed-pair territory the landed round events
price (`freshBad_le`'s conditioning, `Loom/Depth.lean`, CITED). A grinding
adversary must QUERY to see a challenge before committing, and each query is
a log cell the extractor reads: grinding is exposed, abstention is
fixed-pair. -/

/-- **A straightline oracle extractor** for reduction `r` at salt size `s`: a
deterministic function of the prover's OUTPUT and its QUERY LOG alone. No
rewinding, and — unlike the landed `SrExtractor` — NO challenge-vector input:
every challenge it needs must be READ from the log, which is where the
verifier's challenges live (`srFinalChal_eq_answerOf`). This is the BCS
straightline-extraction shape: the witness is recovered from the queries the
prover made. -/

/-- Every log-only extractor is in particular an `SrExtractor` — discard the
supplied challenge vector; the log is the only randomness source it reads.
The log route therefore lands INSIDE the landed FS/SR game, not beside it.
(The converse direction is NOT free: an `SrExtractor` may read the fallback
coins `d` through its challenge-vector input, which no log contains — that
asymmetry is exactly why the log-only shape is the stronger, deployment-
faithful one.) -/

its verifier and Def-4.2 extractor never see a query, which is precisely why
the shifted schedule's lagged roots cannot be priced there. This object keeps
the reduction and AUGMENTS it with the ROM game: the soundness clause runs in
the landed lazily-sampled game (`srTrace`/`srFinalChal`/`fiatShamir`, all
CITED — nothing re-derived), and the extractor consumes the QUERY LOG. The
error carries the `(t + k)` grinding factor of `fsKeystone_proved` — the
per-query try-count `lightClientGrinding_sound` deploys as `(t + n)` — times
the per-slot price `εlog`: each fresh challenge the adversary grinds costs a

/-- **[ACC-rbr-bcs-shifted-resid](a) route (i), STATED** (house law:
statement-first; the obligation named before proof work): the adaptive
increment is priced via the oracle log — an `OracleLogReduction` for the
shifted fold-root reduction whose extractor IS the log-read increment map
wherever the log answers. A prover that makes the fresh challenge score a
false increment must have QUERIED the RO in a way the log exposes; grinding
on `ρ_i` costs one query per try, priced by the `(t + k)` factor — the
`lightClientGrinding_sound` `(t + n)` shape applied at the increment, with
the per-slot price `εlog`. NOT inhabited here — the remaining mass is
`[ORACLE-LOG-program]` (below) plus named engineering (module foot).

ATLAS keystone fields (obligation):

  (`OracleLogProgram`) composed with the fresh-horn fixed-pair bound
  (`unqueried_chal_fresh` reattaches the pair: both roots are output-fixed
  when the challenge is fresh) through the `(t + k)` slot union
  (`GameSlotBound`'s choreography, `Loom/Depth.lean`) — see the residual.
* teeth: the extractor clause pins every inhabitant's output on honest logs
  (`adaptive_pins_extractor_F5` PROVES this bites on the landed F₅ chain);
  and any `εlog` with `(0 + k) · εlog δ < 1` somewhere makes `sound_log` a
  genuine bound, not slack.
* premise-inhabitation: the augmented shape is inhabited
  (`trivialOracleLogReduction`); the shifted reduction and its honest

/-- **[ORACLE-LOG-program] — the missing per-slot lemma, stated precisely.**
The hit horn: the round-`i` designated query was FIRST answered at game slot
`j` (`hitAt`, `Loom/Depth.lean`, CITED — the same slot attribution
`GameSlotBound` unions over), the completed run accepts with the candidate
in `R'_{≤δ}`, and the LOG-READ increment at `i` fails its link. Bounded by
`εslot δ`, per (slot, round) pair — the `(t + k)` union then pays the
try-count, exactly as `freshBad_le`/`gameSlotBound_proved` account the
landed game.

WHY this is the genuinely-new mass and not a re-slotting: at slot `j` the
fresh answer `ρ` is drawn with `h_i` fixed (it sits inside the query) but
`h_{i+1}` NOT yet chosen — the adversary picks it later, and can realize ANY
increment `w` via `h_{i+1} := h_i + ρ • w` (`logIncrement` recovers exactly
that `w`). So the per-slot event cannot be the landed fixed-pair
`accSound_rbr` event (no fixed second word exists at draw time); it must
bound the adversary's CONTINUATION — that after seeing `ρ` it completes an
ACCEPTING run whose log-read increment at `i` is false. That is an
RO-programming / continuation argument over the remaining `≤ t − j` queries:
the folded claim's δ-satisfiability near an increment chosen AFTER `ρ` must
be paid by the acceptance clause at the END of the run (the recommitted full
fold is spot-checked against the aggregate), not by the draw alone — the

/-! ## Residual obligation — prose, not a stub

**What CLOSED here.** The oracle-log vocabulary route (i) needs EXISTS, and
its ground facts are proved by citation into the landed game, not mirrored:
the SR/FS trace IS an `OracleLog` (`srTrace_answerOf` via
`srHandlerRun_lookup`), the FS challenges ARE log reads
(`srFinalChal_eq_answerOf` via `srFinalChal_eq_lookup`), and an unqueried
prefix falls back to an output-independent fresh coin
(`unqueried_chal_fresh`). The outside-`Reduction` objects are DEFINED and
non-vacuous: `StraightlineOracleExtractor` (log-only input; `toSr` embeds it
in the landed game), `OracleLogReduction` (the ROM-game soundness clause at
the `(t + k)·εlog` grinding price), with every inhabitant landing the landed
FS and SR statements (`fs_sound`/`sr_sound` via `fsStraightline_iff_sr`) and
the shape inhabited (`trivialOracleLogReduction`). The straightline
log-reads-the-witness structure is PROVED at the shifted alphabet:
`logIncrement`/`shiftedLogExtractor` recover the committed increments
exactly on honestly-committed logs (`logIncrement_recovers` via
`shifted_increment_recovered`), read the log only at the round's own
designated query (`logIncrement_congr` — the shifted round event's fresh
challenge is formally inert for the witness), and fail without the query
(`logIncrement_none_of_unqueried`). Keystones fire on the landed F₅ chain,
including the kernel-computed teeth that the log's ANSWER (not merely its
presence) is load-bearing (`log_wrong_answer_F5`) and the computed inertness
(`log_inert_F5`).

**What did NOT close, honestly.** `adaptiveIncrement_sound_via_log` is
STATED, not inhabited. The `(t + k)` accounting and the fresh horn are
engineering against landed machinery; the genuinely-open mass is the ONE
per-slot lemma, named formally:

* **[ORACLE-LOG-program]** (`OracleLogProgram`): at the game slot where the
  round-`i` prefix query is first answered, `h_i` is query-fixed but
  `h_{i+1}` is NOT — the adversary can realize ANY increment `w` afterwards
  via `h_{i+1} := h_i + ρ • w`, so the per-slot event cannot be the landed
  fixed-pair `accSound_rbr` event (no fixed second word exists at draw
  time). The lemma must bound the adversary's CONTINUATION: after seeing the
  fresh `ρ`, over its remaining `≤ t − j` queries, the probability of
  completing an ACCEPTING run whose log-read increment at `i` fails its
  link. The acceptance clause (the recommitted full fold spot-checked
  against the aggregate) is what must pay for the post-`ρ` increment choice
  — the adaptive claim-fold-satisfiability event `[ACC-rbr-bcs-resid]`(a)(ii)
  named, now with its game-side quantifiers explicit. This is
  RO-programming / continuation territory; nothing landed prices it yet.
* **Composition engineering** (real work, but shaped by landed proofs): the
  cover of the `sound_log` event by fresh/hit horns at the shifted alphabet
  (the `cover` pattern, `Loom/Depth.lean`), the fresh-horn bound — where
  `unqueried_chal_fresh` reattaches a genuine fixed-pair event, since BOTH
  roots are output-fixed when the challenge is fresh, plausibly priced by
  the `accSound_rbr` family at a zero-increment specialization — and the
  `(t + k)` union (`freshBad_le`/`gameSlotBound_proved`'s choreography rerun
  with the log extractor in the extractor slot). None re-derives
  probability facts; all reuse the `uniformProb` toolkit.
* **Inherited unchanged**: the shifted state design
  (`[ACC-rbr-bcs-shifted-resid]`(b) — zero-challenge wrinkle, boundary
  rounds), `[ZK-RBR-extract]` open lemma A, and the floor
  `[FS-ROM]`/`[COMMIT-CR]`/`hPG` — consumed, never claimed.

**Honest assessment.** The deployed-ZK adaptive bound is now REDUCED to
`[ORACLE-LOG-program]`: the log vocabulary, the witness-from-log structure,
the inertness formalization, and the `(t + k)` landing surface are all real
and proved, and they convert the shifted-schedule attribution problem into a
single per-slot continuation bound. That bound is the genuinely-open
remaining mass — it is where the RO-programming argument (or the route-(ii)
adaptive fold-satisfiability bound, which is its draw-time core) must be
proved. Within reach means: one hard lemma plus Depth-scale bookkeeping, not
a missing theory.

## Ledger

* `OracleLog` / `answerOf` (+ `_nil`, `_cons_self`, `_cons_of_ne`,
  `_eq_none`) — DEFINED/PROVED: the query log and its partial-map reading.
* `srTrace_answerOf` / `srFinalChal_eq_answerOf` / `unqueried_chal_fresh` —
  PROVED (citations into `Loom/FiatShamir.lean`): the landed game IS a log;
  FS challenges are log reads; unqueried prefixes are fresh coins.
* `StraightlineOracleExtractor` (+ `toSr`) / `OracleLogReduction`
  (+ `fs_sound`, `sr_sound`) / `trivialOracleLogReduction` —
  DEFINED/PROVED: the outside-`Reduction` shape, embedded in the landed FS
  and SR statements at `(t + k)·εlog`, and inhabited.
* `logIncrement` / `shiftedLogExtractor` — DEFINED: the log-read increment
  at the shifted BCS alphabet; log-only input.
* `logIncrement_congr` / `logIncrement_recovers` /
  `logIncrement_none_of_unqueried` — PROVED: inertness of the fresh
  challenge for the extracted witness; exact recovery on honest logs
  (`shifted_increment_recovered` CITED); the query is load-bearing.
* `adaptiveIncrement_sound_via_log` — STATED (statement-first Prop with
  ATLAS fields): NOT inhabited; the route's target.
* `OracleLogProgram` — STATED: `[ORACLE-LOG-program]`, the per-slot hit-horn
  continuation bound, the sharpened residual.
* Keystones — `outF5`/`logF5` (+ `'`, `''`), `logF5_answers`,
  `log_recovers_F5` (satisfiable), `log_loadbearing_F5` +
  `log_wrong_answer_F5` (teeth: query AND answer load-bearing, kernel-
  computed), `log_inert_F5` (inertness computed),
  `adaptive_pins_extractor_F5` (the statement bites).
