# Loom.OracleLogLinked — [ORACLE-LOG-linked]: the audit finding (the repaired
per-slot statement is STILL refutable — the statement↔designation channel) and
the guarded repair, CLOSED at the sharp per-slot price `1/|F|`; the linked
reduction GROWN per the derived-path law.

`Loom/OracleLogProgram.lean` refuted `[ORACLE-LOG-program]` (the increment was
never tied to the chain's committed link word), built the repair clause
`LinkOpened`, proved the fixed-pair re-attachment
(`linkOpened_increment_pinned`), and stated the repaired per-slot obligation
`OracleLogProgramLinked` — `[ORACLE-LOG-linked]`. The task here was to prove it
and close the deployed-ZK adaptive bound for the linked reduction.

**Audit finding first (house precedent: `OB2_depth_composition_false`,
`oracleLogProgram_accRbrError_false`): `OracleLogProgramLinked` is REFUTABLE
at the intended price — even at the HONEST designation family.** The repaired
event tests `¬ LinkAligned C (srOut P).stmt.x ch i (extracted)` — alignment at
the ADVERSARY'S OWN statement's channel functionals — against a CALLER-fixed
designation `wrt i`, and NO clause ties the two: the previous lane's repair
re-attached increment↔commitment but left statement↔designation open. The
landed `slotBad`/`HitBad` events (`Loom/Depth.lean`) always carry a statement
guard (`o.stmt ∈ Z`); both oracle-log per-slot statements dropped it. The
two-query adversary `alnPrv` (built below on the landed F₅ chain) exploits
exactly this:

* its statement `alnClaim` carries the functional `alnW = proj 0` with
  `alnW (msEx 0) = 2 ≠ 0` — the honest designated link-0 word MISALIGNS
  against the adversary's own channel (while remaining perfectly aligned for
  the honest `genesis`: `msEx_linkAligned`, CITED);
* it queries the round-0 prefix (slot 0, answer `ρ₀`), commits
  `h₁ := xWord + ρ₀ • msEx 0` — which PASSES the link-opening check against
  the honest root `S₅.commit (msEx 0)` on the nose — queries the round-1
  prefix (slot 1, answer `ρ₁`), and solves the aggregate exactly with the
  last message `ρ₁ • 1⃗` (link-0's target is 0, so `ρ₀` is inert in the
  target; `alnW (ρ₁ • 1⃗) = ρ₁ = 0 + ρ₀·0 + ρ₁·1`);
* the log-read increment at round 0 is `ρ₀⁻¹·ρ₀ • msEx 0 = msEx 0` for every
  `ρ₀ ≠ 0` — misaligned FOR THE ADVERSARY'S STATEMENT by construction.

So the repaired event holds whenever `ρ₀ ≠ 0`: any admissible `εslot` is
forced `≥ 4/5` (`oracleLogProgramLinked_forces`), and `[ORACLE-LOG-linked]` at
`εslot = accRbrError = 1/5` is FALSE (`oracleLogProgramLinked_accRbrError_false`)
— at the honest designation `wrt k = S₅.commit (msEx k)`, on the landed chain.
Note the tether itself held: `alnPrv` PASSES `LinkOpened` honestly. The hole
is one level up, in what "misaligned" is measured against.

**The guarded repair — and it CLOSES, at the sharp price.** Two new generic
theorems make the guarded per-slot bound a short argument:

* `recoverFromColumns_line` + `linkOpened_increment_pinned_free` — erasure
  recovery (`Lagrange.interpolate` + `evalOnDomain`, both linear maps) is
  AFFINE in the opened columns, so the landed pin's codeword-columns premise
  on the PREVIOUS message is not needed: under `LinkOpened` + binding alone,
  at any nonzero recorded challenge, the `ρ⁻¹`-difference of the two
  synthesized words IS the designated codeword — junk previous columns
  included. (Supersedes `linkOpened_increment_pinned`'s `hu`/`hπ` premises;
  the landed lemma remains for the honest-analysis route.)
* `hitAt_answerOf` — on the hit horn the recorded answer IS the tested game
  coin: the `hquery` pinning inside `hitBad_fibre_le` (CITED), made a
  portable, fibre-free citation via the `runFrom` machinery.

`OracleLogLinkedAligned` is `OracleLogProgramLinked` with designations given
as WORDS `wv` and ONE added conjunct — the statement guard
`LinkAligned C (srOut P).stmt.x ch i (wv i)` (the `Z`-clause in its sharpest
per-round form; `Z := {st | ∀ i, LinkAligned C st.x ch i (wv i)}` is the
deployed statement set, inhabited by the honest chain: `msEx_linkAligned`).
Under the guard the event is CONTAINED in `{coins | c_j = 0}`: at `c_j ≠ 0`
the extracted increment is pinned to `wv i` (`hitAt_answerOf` +
`linkOpened_increment_pinned_free`), which the guard says IS aligned —
contradicting the event's misalignment conjunct. One coin coordinate pinned:
`uniformProb ≤ 1/|F|` (`splitProd1` + `uniformProb_prod_le`, CITED). That is
`oracleLogLinkedAligned_proved` — the hit-horn per-slot mass of the deployed-ZK
adaptive bound, CLOSED at `1/|F| ≤ accRbrError`
(`oracleLogLinkedAligned_accRbrError`), sharper than the budgeted price.

**The reduction grows the clause (derived-path law).**
`accReductionBcsShiftedLinked` = `accReductionBcsShifted` with `verify`
strengthened by the per-round link-opening conjunct against the designated
words — the deployment's actual check, superseding the twin (the unlinked
reduction remains upstream as the refutation's carrier; new work targets the
linked one). `linked_verify_strengthens` (acceptance ⟹ unlinked acceptance,
same output, + every round's `LinkOpened`) is the composition's discharge
lemma; `linked_verify_honest` (completeness, CITING `shifted_verify_honest` +
`linkOpened_honest` — nothing re-derived) shows the growth excludes no honest
prover; `progMsgs_linked_rejected` (teeth) shows the zero-tether refuter of
`[ORACLE-LOG-program]` now DIES inside the verifier itself
(`progLinkOpened_refuted`'s computation, CITED, re-run at the deployed
designation `msEx 1`: binding forces `2 + ρ = 1 + ρ`).

/-! ## Residual obligation — prose, not a stub

**What CLOSED here.**

* **`[ORACLE-LOG-linked]` is SETTLED — negatively, with teeth** (third
  finding in the `OB2_depth_composition_false` tradition on this route). The
  statement-channel refuter `alnPrv` (TWO queries, on the landed F₅ chain, at
  the HONEST designation family `S₅.commit (msEx k)`) makes the repaired
  per-slot event hold whenever its round-0 challenge is nonzero: it passes
  the link-opening tether honestly (`alnLinkOpened`), accepts exactly
  (`alnVerify`/`alnAggSat` — its own channel `alnW = proj 0` keeps the
  aggregate solvable), and its pinned increment `msEx 0` misaligns against
  its OWN statement's channel (`alnW (msEx 0) = 2 ≠ 0`, kernel-checked)
  while remaining perfectly aligned for the honest genesis
  (`msEx_linkAligned`). Machine-checked: `oracleLogProgramLinked_forces`
  (any admissible `εslot ≥ 4/5`) and
  `oracleLogProgramLinked_accRbrError_false` (the intended `1/|F|` price is
  false). The previous lane's repair re-attached increment↔commitment but
  left statement↔designation untethered — the event measures alignment at
  the ADVERSARY's channel against CALLER-fixed designations, and the landed
  `slotBad`'s statement guard (`stmt ∈ Z`) had been dropped from both
  oracle-log per-slot statements.
* **The guarded per-slot bound is PROVED, at the sharp price `1/|F|`**
  (`OracleLogLinkedAligned` / `oracleLogLinkedAligned_proved`, budget form
  `oracleLogLinkedAligned_accRbrError`, F₅ firing at `1/5`
  `oracleLogLinkedAligned_F5`). The guard is the per-round `Z`-clause
  `LinkAligned C stmt.x ch i (wv i)`; under it the event is CONTAINED in
  `{c_j = 0}`: `hitAt_answerOf` (NEW, generic — the hit-horn's recorded
  answer IS the tested coin, `hitBad_fibre_le`'s `hquery` pinning made a
  portable citation) plus `linkOpened_increment_pinned_free` (NEW — the
  increment pin with NO premise on the previous message's columns, since
  erasure recovery is AFFINE in the columns, `recoverFromColumns_line`) pin
  the extracted increment to the designated word, which the guard says is
  aligned — contradiction with the misalignment conjunct. The hit-horn
  per-slot mass of the deployed-ZK adaptive bound is CLOSED — genuinely
  fixed-pair, no continuation bound, no per-fibre choreography needed. The
  guard's teeth: `alnGuarded_zero` (the refuter's guarded event is EMPTY).
* **The reduction GREW the clause** (derived-path law):
  `accReductionBcsShiftedLinked` conjoins the per-round `LinkOpened` check
  against the designated words into `verify`, superseding the unlinked twin
  for all downstream work. `linked_verify_strengthens` (linked acceptance ⟹
  unlinked acceptance, same output, + all round openings — the composition's
  discharge lemma), `linked_verify_of_shifted` + `linked_verify_honest`
  (completeness, CITING `shifted_verify_honest` and `linkOpened_honest`),
  `linked_completeness_F5` (fired), and `progMsgs_linked_rejected` (teeth:
  the zero-tether refuter of `[ORACLE-LOG-program]` is rejected INSIDE the
  verifier — `progLinkOpened_refuted`'s binding computation at the deployed
  designation).

**`[ORACLE-LOG-linked-resid]`** — what remains for the full deployed-ZK
adaptive bound `(t + k)·accRbrError` over the linked reduction, stated
precisely:

* **(a) The fresh horn at nonzero-target links.** When round `i`'s designated
  prefix is unqueried, the challenge is the output-independent fresh coin
  (`unqueried_chal_fresh`, CITED) and the extractor reads `0`
  (`logIncrement_none_of_unqueried`, CITED). Over the deployed statement set
  the zero word is aligned iff the link's targets vanish (weights are
  linear), so zero-target links have EMPTY fresh events. For a link with
  some nonzero target `τ_{i,j₀} ≠ 0`: the output — hence the last word `y'`
  and every message — is fixed before the fresh coin `d_i` exists, the
  aggregate's `j₀`-target is AFFINE in `d_i` with slope `τ_{i,j₀}`, and
  `RelaxedMem R'` at `δ < dC/2` pins at most ONE good draw by unique
  decoding (two accepted draws give two satisfiers within `2δ < dC` of the
  same `y'`, hence equal, hence equal affine targets, hence equal draws) —
  per-slot mass `1/|F|`. The slicing is `freshBad_le`'s `splitCoord`
  choreography verbatim; the unique-decoding pin is the one genuinely new
  lemma. NOT proved here.
* **(b) The `(t + k)` assembly.** Over
  `Z_dep := {st | AccClaim.Satisfies C st.x st.y ∧
  ∀ i, LinkAligned C st.x ch i (wv i)}` (the deployed statement set: genesis
  true + channel aligned with the chain's designations — the guard's home;
  honest F₅ inhabitant: `genesis` with `msEx_linkAligned`), the linked
  `sound_log` event decomposes: genesis satisfiability collapses
  `¬ RelaxedMem R` to `∃ i, ¬ LinkAligned … (w i)` (the links clause is
  `ystar`-independent); `logSlot_cover` (CITED) splits each round into
  fresh/hit horns; linked acceptance discharges every hit horn's
  `LinkOpened` conjunct (`linked_verify_strengthens`) and `Z_dep` its guard;
  the per-`j` union event `∃ i, hit(i, j) ∧ …` is contained in the SAME
  `{c_j = 0}` (the containment is uniform in `i`), so each of the `t` game
  slots pays `1/|F|` once — not once per round; the `k` fresh slots pay (a);
  `uniformProb_exists_le` (CITED) sums to `(t + k)·accRbrError`. This is
  `gameSlotBound_proved`-shape bookkeeping over landed lemmas — real but
  mechanical; not rerun here.
* **(c) Inherited unchanged**: the shifted state design
  (`[ACC-rbr-bcs-shifted-resid]`(b)), `[ZK-RBR-extract]` lemma A, and the
  floor `[FS-ROM]`/`[COMMIT-CR]`/`hPG` — consumed, never claimed.

**Honest assessment.** The deployed-ZK adaptive-increment bound is NOT yet
closed, and `[ACC-rbr-bcs-shifted-resid]`(a) is NOT yet settled — the task's
premise ("now well-posed after the repair") was FALSE: the repaired per-slot
statement still had a hole, one level up from the one it fixed, and proving
it as posed was impossible. What this lane delivers instead: the refutation
(machine-checked, at the honest designation, with the tether satisfied — so
the finding isolates the statement↔designation channel exactly), the
guarded statement that survives it, and the guarded bound PROVED at `1/|F|`
— the hit-horn mass of the composition, which was the genuinely-contested
piece (the previous refutation showed no fixed pair existed there at all;
now one does, and it prices). The remaining mass — fresh-horn
unique-decoding pin + the `(t + k)` assembly over `Z_dep` — is named sharp
in (a)/(b) and is `freshBad_le`/`gameSlotBound_proved`-shaped work over
landed machinery, with no open structural question left in it.

## Ledger

* `uniformProb_not` / `uniformProb_eq_single` / `uniformProb_prod_coord_le`
  — PROVED: complement counting; one pinned coin coordinate costs `1/|F|`
  (`splitProd1` + `uniformProb_prod_le`, CITED).
* `recoverFromColumns_line` — PROVED: erasure recovery is affine in the
  opened columns (`Lagrange.interpolate` + `evalOnDomain` linearity).
* `linkOpened_increment_pinned_free` — PROVED: the increment pin with NO
  previous-message premise; supersedes the landed pin's `hu`/`hπ` on the
  analysis side (`binding_columns` + `recoverFromColumns_sound`, CITED).
* `hitAt_answerOf` — PROVED (generic): on the hit horn the recorded answer
  IS the tested coin — `hitBad_fibre_le`'s `hquery` pinning, portable.
* `alnW`/`alnClaim`/`alnMsgs`/`alnOut`/`alnQ0`/`alnQ1`/`alnPrv` — BUILT:
  the two-query statement-channel refuter on the landed F₅ chain.
* `alnTrace`/`alnSrOut`/`alnHit`/`alnAnswer0`/`alnChal1`/`alnAggSat`/
  `alnVerify`/`alnLinkOpened`/`alnExtract`/`alnMisaligned` — PROVED: the
  run hits at slot 0, passes the tether honestly, accepts exactly on every
  draw, and its pinned increment misaligns against its own statement at
  every nonzero draw (kernel-checked).
* `oracleLogProgramLinked_forces` / `oracleLogProgramLinked_accRbrError_false`
  — PROVED: `[ORACLE-LOG-linked]` forces `εslot ≥ 4/5`; the intended
  `accRbrError` price is FALSE — at the honest designation.
* `OracleLogLinkedAligned` — STATED (`[ORACLE-LOG-linked-aligned]`,
  statement-first, ATLAS fields): the guarded per-slot obligation.
* `oracleLogLinkedAligned_proved` / `_accRbrError` / `_F5` — PROVED: the
  guarded bound at the SHARP price `1/|F|` (≤ `accRbrError`; `1/5` fired).
* `alnAligned_guard_false` / `alnGuarded_zero` — PROVED (guard teeth): the
  refuter's guarded event is EMPTY.
* `accReductionBcsShiftedLinked` — DEFINED (derived-path): verify GROWN by
  the per-round link-opening clause; `linked_verify_strengthens` /
  `linked_verify_of_shifted` / `linked_verify_honest` — PROVED
  (characterization + completeness, `shifted_verify_honest` +
  `linkOpened_honest` CITED); `linked_completeness_F5` — fired;
  `progMsgs_linked_rejected` — PROVED (teeth: `progPrv`'s family rejected
  inside the verifier, `progLinkOpened_refuted`'s computation CITED).
* `[ORACLE-LOG-linked-resid]` — prose above: (a) fresh-horn unique-decoding
  pin at nonzero-target links, (b) the `(t + k)` assembly over `Z_dep`,
  (c) inherited.
