# Loom.LightClientFS — [LC-sound-fs]: the Fiat–Shamir-derived schedule inherits
# the light-client bound.

The LAST derandomization step. `Loom/LightClientSound.lean` proved the one-shot
probabilistic light client over a UNIFORM i.i.d. challenge schedule
(`lightClientSound`, `n·(err⋆(δ) + 1/|F|)`; `lightClientSound_exact`, sharp
`1/|F|`). The deployed light client is NON-INTERACTIVE: it derives each link's
challenge by hashing the transcript prefix — Fiat–Shamir, σ-before-γ. This file
closes the transport: in the ROM (`Loom/FiatShamir.lean`'s lazy-sampling
`Oracle` handler, REUSED not re-derived), the FS-derived schedule of a FIXED
chain is distributed EXACTLY as the uniform schedule, so both bounds transfer
VERBATIM to the non-interactive verifier.

The argument, in three proved steps:

* **Prefix distinctness (`linkPrefix_injective`) — the load-bearing fact.**
  Link `k`'s challenge is derived at the transcript prefix through link `k`
  (genesis + links `0..k`, roots and claims included — σ-before-γ: the link's
  commitment enters the hash before its challenge exists). Distinct links have
  prefixes of distinct LENGTHS, so the `n` derivation queries are pairwise
  distinct — the mirror of `SrOutput.query_injective` (Loom/FiatShamir.lean),
  proved, not assumed. This is exactly what makes FS sound here: repeated or
  colliding queries would REPLAY logged coins and correlate the schedule.
* **Distinct fresh queries each draw their own coin
  (`Oracle.lookup_foldl_respond`).** The handler-fold law: folding `respond`
  over a duplicate-free list of pairwise-distinct queries, all fresh, logs
  every query with exactly its step's coin — lazy sampling answers each
  distinct fresh query with a FRESH uniform draw (`respond_fresh_*` iterated,
  with the frame law `lookup_respond_ne` insulating the earlier entries).
* **The transfer (`fsSchedule_fsDerive` → `fsSchedule_uniform`).** Therefore
  the FS-derived schedule, as the handler actually computes it
  (`fsSchedule (fsDerive A₀ ch c) A₀ ch d = c`), IS the fresh-coin tuple —
  whatever the lazy fallback `d`. The pushforward of the ROM's coin measure
  through the derivation is the uniform schedule measure ON THE NOSE, and
  `lightClientSound` / `lightClientSound_exact` fire unchanged:
  `lightClientFS_sound` (THE DEPLOYABLE NON-INTERACTIVE HEADLINE,
  `n·(err⋆(δ) + 1/|F|)`), `lightClientFS_exact` (sharp `1/|F|`),
  `lightClientFS_of_not_attests` (the `attests`-interface form).

**Keystones (F₅, computing, reusing `LCExample`/`LCSoundExample`):** the
phantom chain — the forger of the rigged schedule `(1,1)` — under the
FS-DERIVED schedule forges exactly when the ROM's coins land on the diagonal
(`phantom_fs_verifies_iff`): probability EXACTLY `1/5 = 1/|F₅|`
(`phantom_fs_forging_prob`, the exact bound ATTAINED), the general theorems
fire on it with every hypothesis discharged (`phantom_fs_caught_probably`,
`phantom_fs_delta_fired`), the true δ-event probability is computed
(`phantom_fs_delta_prob_eq` — union-bound slack visible), and both poles
compute: coins `(1,1)` forge, coins `(1,0)` catch — the verdict is the
ORACLE's doing. The honest chain verifies at probability 1
(`goodChain_fs_verifies_prob_one` — FS costs the honest prover nothing), and
its derived schedule is well-defined (= the coins) for every fallback.

**What this does NOT close (honest residuals, end of file):** the chain here
is FIXED before the oracle samples — the non-adaptive/honest-derivation form.
A `t`-query ROM adversary that GRINDS (chooses the chain after seeing oracle
answers) pays the `(t + n)` factor of WARP Thm B.4; that strengthening is
`[LC-fs-adaptive]`, riding `[ACC-sound-rbr]` + the landed `fsKeystone_proved`.
The hash-realizes-handler idealization stays `[FS-ROM]` (Loom/FiatShamir.lean);
binding the prover's words to the fold stays `[ACC-extract]`.

/-! ## Ledger, and what remains of [LC-sound-fs] (honest residuals, prose)

**Closed here** (no sorry, no new axioms):

* `linkPrefix_injective` — the prefix DISTINCTNESS, a real proof (prefix
  lengths grow), not an assumption: the fact that makes FS sound at all.
* `Oracle.lookup_foldl_respond` (+ the fold frame law) — distinct fresh
  queries each draw their own coin: the lazy-sampling handler's fold-level
  uniformity, built on FiatShamir's single-step laws.
* `fsSchedule_fsDerive` / `fsSchedule_uniform` — THE TRANSFER: the FS-derived
  schedule of a fixed chain IS the fresh-coin tuple (every fallback), so its
  distribution is uniform on the nose and every schedule event keeps its
  probability. The pushforward realizer is the identity — no measure
  machinery needed, which is exactly what distinctness+freshness buy.
* `lightClientFS_sound` / `lightClientFS_exact` /
  `lightClientFS_of_not_attests` — both light-client bounds, inherited
  VERBATIM by the non-interactive verifier: `n·(err⋆(δ) + 1/|F|)` and the
  sharp `1/|F|`. `[LC-sound-fs]` is closed at this (fixed-chain) level: the
  deployable non-interactive form carries the proved numbers.

**Remaining, named, with realizers:**

* **[LC-fs-adaptive]** — the chain here is FIXED before the ROM samples: the
  derivation's `n` queries are the oracle's ONLY queries, and the adversary
  does not see coins before committing the chain. A grinding adversary — `t`
  oracle queries, chain chosen afterwards — re-derives schedules until one
  forges, paying the union bound over its queries: WARP Thm B.4's
  `(t + k)·ε_rbr` shape, PROVED in general as `FsOfRbrSound`/
  `fsKeystone_proved` (Loom/FiatShamir.lean, unconditional). Consuming it
  here needs the light-client per-fold bounds packaged as an RBR round
  function — `[ACC-sound-rbr]` (named in Loom/AccSound.lean), the same
  packaging `[ACC-extract]` rides. Nothing about the BOUND SHAPE changes;
  the price becomes `(t + n)·(err⋆ + 1/|F|)` for a `t`-query adversary.
* **[FS-ROM]** (inherited, Loom/FiatShamir.lean) — the deployed hash
  realizing the lazy-sampling handler is the one named idealization; domain
  separation of `LcQuery` from the stack's other oracle uses is priced there.
* **[ACC-extract]** (unchanged, Loom/Accumulator.lean) — events here anchor
  at the honest fold of committed words; binding a forging prover's
  recommitments to that fold is the erasure-extraction obligation.

**Audit notes (does the FS schedule GENUINELY inherit the bound?).** The
inheritance rests on exactly two facts, both proved: (1) the derivation
queries are pairwise DISTINCT — `linkPrefix_injective`, by the growing prefix
length, mirroring `SrOutput.query_injective`; a collision would replay a coin
and the diagonal event below would inflate; (2) distinct fresh queries draw
independent fresh coins — `Oracle.lookup_foldl_respond`, from the landed
handler laws. Non-vacuity is computed: the transfer is exercised end-to-end
on the phantom chain, whose FS forging event is EXACTLY the coin diagonal
(`phantom_fs_verifies_iff`) at probability exactly the sharp bound
(`phantom_fs_forging_prob` = `1/5`), with both poles decided (coins `(1,1)`
forge, `(1,0)` catch). The general theorems fire with all hypotheses
discharged (`phantom_fs_caught_probably`, `phantom_fs_delta_fired`), the true
δ-probability is computed (`phantom_fs_delta_prob_eq` — slack visible), and
the honest chain pays nothing (`goodChain_fs_verifies_prob_one` = 1). The
fallback argument `d` of `fsSchedule` is universally quantified everywhere —
the theorems hold for EVERY fallback because the derivation logs every
prefix, so no conclusion smuggles strength through the default. -/
