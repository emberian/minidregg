# Loom.SpongeIndiffPrefixOutput — successful construction returns the RO value

`programPrefixes` reconciles or programs every nonempty message prefix.  This
module proves the load-bearing output theorem: whenever the interpreter
succeeds on a nonempty suffix, its final state's rate is exactly the response
logged for the full prefix.  Consequently `programConstruction` answers with
the lazy RO value of the complete public message, in both construction-first
and primitive-first executions.
