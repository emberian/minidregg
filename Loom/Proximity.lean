# Loom.Proximity — the FRI/WHIR folding low-degree test (the rate<1 linchpin).

The ONE reduction behind `[DEC-proximity]`, `[OB3-c-prox]`, `[ACC-sound-list]`:
turning "is this word δ-close to the Reed–Solomon code" into a checkable
claim, by iterated folding down to a directly-checkable constant.

**Construction** (FRI/BS08; WHIR §2/§4 folding): a word `f` on a domain `L`
closed under negation folds, at challenge `α`, to the word on `L²`

  `Fold(f, α)(x²) = (f(x) + f(−x))/2 + α · (f(x) − f(−x))/(2x)`

— the even/odd decomposition `p(X) = pₑ(X²) + X·pₒ(X²)` evaluated: a
degree-<2d codeword folds to the degree-<d codeword `pₑ + α·pₒ`. A
`FoldingTower` iterates this down to degree < 1, where membership is literally
"the word is constant" (`mem_reedSolomonCode_one_iff`). Towers are NECESSARILY
finite: the section `sec` makes `sq` surjective, so levels halve exactly
(`card_eq_two_mul_card`) — the `j < m` guard is mathematics, not convenience.

**PROVED here, no sorry, standard axioms only** (propext/choice/Quot.sound):

* the even/odd algebra: decomposition identity, degree halving, and the
  recomposition `pₑ(X²) + X·pₒ(X²)` with its degree bound — both directions;
* `fold` well-definedness (the section choice is immaterial: `foldEven_sq`,
  `foldOdd_sq`), the reconstruction identity `E(x²) + x·O(x²) = f(x)`, and
  **`fold_preserves_code`** — one round is complete;
* **`proximity_complete`** — an honest codeword passes the whole descent for
  EVERY challenge stream (`word_mem_code`, induction on the tower);
* **`proximity_far_covering`** — the FRI round-reduction STRUCTURE: a δ-far
  word's acceptance event is covered by per-round, prefix-measurable
  (`word_congr`) bad sets of size ≤ b, given per-level distance preservation.
  The output is EXACTLY the input shape of `AdaptiveUnionBound`
  (Loom/Sumcheck.lean), so the two compose on sight;
* the adaptive counting union bound (`card_filter_exists_coord_mem_le`,
  fiberwise counting) and the heads **`proximity_sound`** (≤ m·b·|F|^{m−1}
  accepting tuples) and **`proximity_sound_prob`** (probability ≤ m·b/|F|);
* **`fold_notMem_of_notMem`** — the exact-membership folding lemma, `b = 1`,
  UNCONDITIONAL: the fold is affine in α, two good challenges force both
  components into the linear code, recomposition puts `f` in the code;
* **`close_of_correlatedAgreement`** — correlated agreement of the two fold
  components lifts through the `sq`-preimage (`card_sq_preimage`) to δ-close
  the word itself: the arrow that makes proximity gaps imply folding
  soundness.

**The residual `[PROX-fold-distance]`** (`FoldDistancePreserving`, bad-set
form: a δ-far word folds δ-far off ≤ b challenges) is not a monolith — it is
delivered in one regime and REDUCED in the other:

* sub-quantization `0 ≤ δ < 1/|κ|`: **PROVED**, `b = 1`
  (`foldDistancePreserving_of_lt_inv_card`) — so the iterated test is
  end-to-end sound TODAY at exact-membership resolution: the F₅ keystone
  discharges EVERY hypothesis of `proximity_sound` and attains the bound;
* macroscopic `δ ∈ (0, 1−B)`: **REDUCED**
  (`foldDistancePreserving_of_isProximityGenerator`, `b ≥ err(δ)·|F|`) to
  `IsProximityGenerator (affineGenerator F)` for the folded RS code — WHIR
  Theorem 4.8 / BCIKS 2020/654, the SAME standing `hPG` hypothesis that
  Loom/ReedSolomon.lean's Corollary 4.11 carries. ONE proximity-gap
  hypothesis now gates the entire rate<1 story (mutual CA and the LDT
  alike); its UD-regime instantiation is the ladder's next rung
  (docs/LOOM-RECOMPOSITION.md §5) and is NOT claimed here.

**Honest scope limits.** This is the folding/decision skeleton of the LDT at
claim resolution, matching the strict decider contract (`[DEC-proximity]`):
the verifier here reads whole level words. NOT modeled: the oracle/Merkle
query phase (spot-checks, per-round consistency openings, their
`t = λ/−log(1−δ)` repetition — that layer is `[DEC-open]`-adjacent), the
derandomized powers-of-α batching, and the WHIR-style δ-vs-min(δ,·) radius
refinements (absorbed into the bad-set abstraction). The probability
statement is uniform counting over challenge tuples `Fin m → F` — the
`uniformProb` rendering lives in Loom/Sumcheck.lean's engine, whose import
chain (Loom.Depth) is lane-blocked; unification of the two union-bound
renderings is flagged integration debt, not hidden.

/-! ## Folding domains

The structure a domain needs to support one FRI fold: closure under negation
(`neg`, an involution through `dom`), a squaring projection `sq` onto the next
level's index set, and a computable section `sec` of `sq` (each folded point
names a square root — keeps `fold` computable for the concrete keystones).
`sec` forces `sq` surjective, so `|ι| = 2·|κ|` exactly: folding domains halve,
and towers over a finite field are NECESSARILY finite (the `j < m` guard in
`FoldingTower` below is mathematics, not convenience). `dom`/`domSq` are
PARAMETERS, not fields, so consecutive tower levels share their embedding
definitionally — no coherence conditions anywhere. -/

A tower is a chain of folding domains `ι 0 → ι 1 → ⋯ → ι m`. The level

a parameter, so consecutive levels agree definitionally — no coherence
conditions. The `j < m` guard on the folding data is forced by mathematics,

/-! ## Keystones (ATLAS law 2: satisfiable + teeth + premise inhabitation)

The one-round tower over F₅: level 0 = `{1,2,3,4}` (all units, closed under
negation), level 1 = `{1,4}` (the squares), degree schedule `2 → 1`.

* **satisfiable**: the line `X`'s evaluations `(1,2,3,4)` fold, at every α, to
  the CONSTANT word `α` — computed by `decide` at `α = 3` and delivered in
  general by `fold_preserves_code`; completeness fires end-to-end.
* **teeth**: the spike word `(0,1,0,0)` is `1/5`-far from the level-0 code
  (proved via root counting, reusing `card_agreeSet_lt_of_ne`); the test
  ACCEPTS it exactly at the single bad challenge `α = 3` and rejects the other
  four — the acceptance set is computed EXACTLY, and `proximity_sound`'s bound
  `m·b·|F|^{m−1} = 1` is ATTAINED with equality, not slack.
* **premise inhabitation**: the `[PROX-fold-distance]` hypothesis of
  `proximity_sound` is discharged by the PROVED sub-quantization realizer
  (`foldDistancePreserving_of_lt_inv_card`, `b = 1`) — the end-to-end bound
  below carries NO residual hypothesis at all. -/
