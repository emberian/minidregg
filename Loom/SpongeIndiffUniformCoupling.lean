# Loom.SpongeIndiffUniformCoupling — probability transport for work coins

The deterministic oracle lemmas permit eager prefix samples to move past
distinct lazy samples.  A probability proof must additionally show that the
resulting transformation is a bijection of the *whole fixed work coin space*.
This module states that boundary exactly and proves the counting transport.

A `UniformWorkCoupling` contains an actual equivalence of
`Fin work → Rate × Cap`, not merely matching marginals, and a pointwise
equivalence of the two events under that map.  Uniform probabilities are then
equal.  Coordinate permutations provide concrete nontrivial examples.  The
full adaptive sponge hop must still build a coupling whose reindexing follows
the construction/reveal schedule; it is not asserted here.
