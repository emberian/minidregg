# Loom.SpongeIndiffLazyConstruction — execute construction through a lazy table

The landed ideal game answers `.constr` directly from its RO and leaves the
simulator table unchanged.  An identical-until-bad proof additionally needs a
hidden primitive table populated by every absorbed construction block.  This
module supplies that missing operational object.

`lazyAbsorb` consumes exactly one candidate primitive answer per message
block, replaying existing table entries and extending fresh ones through the
same `Oracle.respond` laws used everywhere else.  `coupledConstruction` then
joins that primitive execution to one lazy RO answer and fails closed unless
the final squeezed rate is exactly the RO answer.  No probability or
permutation-distribution claim is made here; freshness, collision pricing, and
the later transcript coupling remain separate.
