# Loom.ZkExtraction — [ZK-RBR-interleave] missing lemma 2 attacked:
MASKED-CHAIN EXTRACTION. The flank splits in two, with opposite fates — both
PROVED — and the genuinely-open remainder sharpens to `[ZK-RBR-extract]`.

`Loom/RbrZeroKnowledge.lean` named the extraction flank as the residual's
missing lemma 2: in deployment the chain extractor's `n + 1` transcripts are
erasure-corrected from the SAME `t·n` opened columns the simulator must
reproduce; the mask-augmented chain's extractor must peel `(witness, mask)`
pairs, and its flat family must perturb MASK coordinates — counterfactuals
the honest protocol never runs, which the seam must furnish "WITHOUT handing
the ZK distinguisher a second schedule". `Loom/ZkTriangular.lean` closed the
hiding flank (missing lemma 1) at the model level; this file attacks the
extraction flank. The finding is a genuine RESOLUTION of the posed question,
not a closure of the whole flank:

**The question splits at the resolution of the extraction target.**

* **At MASKED RESOLUTION — extract the masked words — everything closes.**
  - `extractChain_flatFold`: the chain extractor inverts the honest flat
    chain word EXACTLY, arbitrary depth (`foldWords_ofFn` bridges to the
    landed `foldWords`, so this is the real chain word). The general theorem
    behind the landed F₅ `extractChain_recovers` computation.
  - `mask_sat_of_ker` + `maskedChain_knowledge_sound`: HOMOGENEOUS masks
    (targets `0` — `constrainedMaskSpace`'s shape, the landed mask design)
    are invisible to the claim channel, so the masked words ARE witnesses of
    the UNCHANGED claim chain, and the δ-schedule family alone — no mask
    counterfactual anywhere — extracts them exactly and `Forall₂`-certifies
    the whole chain. Adversarial-transcript form: the claim chain never
    moved, so it is the landed `extractChain_sound` VERBATIM, nothing to
    re-derive. Completeness of the masked protocol on the REAL aggregate:
    `masked_aggregate_satisfies` (via `aggregate_satisfies`, cited).
  - **The seam furnishes the counterfactuals from ONE execution**:
    successive recommitted partial folds differ by one γ-weighted masked
    word (`partialFold_succ`), so `t ≥ d` opened columns erasure-decode the
    increment (`recoverFromColumns_sound`, CITED) and `seamCounterfactual` —
    a pure function of the base transcript, the public schedules, and the
    opened columns; NO witness, NO mask, NO second run in its type —
    synthesizes the exact perturbed transcripts (`seamCounterfactual_sound`),
    through binding (`extractChain_committed_seam`, `[ACC-extract-bind]`
    composed end to end). One straightline FS execution serves the two-point
    extractor at every link.
  - **What extraction reveals is the simulator's own object**: the extracted
    words' openings ARE `jointOpen` — definitionally
    (`extracted_openings_are_jointOpen`, `rfl`) — and sweep the full public
    space over the mask draw (`extraction_surface_witness_free`, citing
    `rbrZeroKnowledge_of_rounds`); the FULL extracted word ranges over the
    claim's own PUBLIC satisfying set, identically for every witness
    (`mask_image_homTwin` / `extracted_word_witness_free`, citing
    `mask_bijOn`). Running the extractor hands the distinguisher nothing the
    simulator does not already produce.

* **At PAIR RESOLUTION — peel `(witness, mask)` — the counterfactual is
  provably NOT furnishable, and provably NOT needed.**
  - `extractMaskedPair` + `extractMaskedPair_sound`: the pair peel is
    complete algebra GIVEN transcripts at a perturbed MASK schedule — the
    `2n + 1`-transcript extractor the residual asked for, exact at arbitrary
    depth. `MaskedChainExtraction` states it with the quantifier positions
    explicit: its type carries BOTH `γalt` and `ηalt`.
  - `masked_pair_ambiguous`: two DISTINCT valid `(witness, mask)` families
    with EQUAL masked-word families — so every transcript at EVERY
    δ-schedule, every opened column, every function of the honest execution
    coincides. The mask counterfactual is not a function of the honest
    protocol's data; no straightline extractor reading one execution peels
    the pair. This impossibility IS hiding working (the pair is what ZK
    protects), and it is harmless: masked resolution already carries
    claim-level knowledge.
  - The games separate by quantifier position and it is VISIBLE in the
    types: `maskedExtraction_coexists_hiding` (both hold on one `(M, q, ηs)`),
    `zero_mask_kills_hiding_not_pair` (η-dial kills hiding, never the peel),
    `mask_diagonal_kills_pair_not_hiding` (one mask schedule collapses the
    peel to `0`, hiding untouched — `RbrZeroKnowledge`'s type cannot mention
    `ηalt`).

* **The parameter window — the sharp quantitative core.** The seam needs
  `d ≤ t`; constrained-mask hiding needs `t + 1 ≤ d`; they NEVER share a `t`
  (`not_constrainedMask_hiding_of_recoverable` — recoverability refutes
  constrained hiding at EVERY challenge, via `open_determines`). The
  whole-code mask coexists with the seam at exactly `t = d`
  (`seam_hiding_coexist_at_d`): the columns fully determine the masked word
  (the extractor's food) while revealing nothing about the witness (the
  simulator's promise) — no contradiction, because what they determine IS
  the masked word. All three regimes computed on one F₅ instance
  (`window_F5`). Consequence — the honest dichotomy: homogeneous masks make
  masked words witnesses but push the seam beyond unique decoding
  (`[ZK-RBR-extract]` open lemma A); whole-code masks keep the seam at
  `t = d` but shift the folded targets, so the mask claims must ride as
  links with their own targets, whose pair-level extraction is exactly the
  provably-unfurnishable counterfactual.

* **The deployment bridge, delivered as a bonus**: `partialFold_eq_triFold`
  identifies the masked chain's recommitted partial fold with
  `Loom/ZkTriangular.lean`'s `triFold` at the PRODUCT schedule `δ·η` (the
  algebraic half of `[ZK-RBR-triangular]`'s named bridge), and
  `masked_partialFold_hiding` transports `TriangularHiding` verbatim: the
  very columns `seamCounterfactual` decodes are jointly uniform and
  witness-free. One data surface, two games, both satisfied — the
  composition `[ZK-RBR-interleave]` asked whether could exist, exhibited.

**Keystones** (F₅, the SAME instance as `RbrZkExample`/`ZkTriangularExample`):
masked knowledge extraction fired + computed (`masked_knowledge_F5`,
`masked_extraction_computes`); the pair peel fired + computed with the
supplied mask counterfactual (`maskedChainExtraction_F5`,
`pair_extraction_computes` — both rounds' pairs on the nose); the ambiguity
teeth fired + computed (`pair_ambiguous_F5`, `ambiguity_computed`); the seam
fired bare and through the ideal binding commitment (`seam_extraction_F5`,
`seam_extraction_committed_F5`); the window's three regimes (`window_F5`);
game separation both directions (`separation_F5`, `zero_mask_F5`,
`mask_diagonal_F5`); the deployed surface witness-free for ALL witnesses
(`deployed_surface_F5`). No `sorry`, no vacuous `Prop := True`.

**Honest scope.** Masked-resolution closure is relative to the
unique-decoding seam (`d ≤ t`, genuine codewords — the same honest boundary
as `Loom/Erasure.lean`) and to the flat/product model of the chain word (the
absorption WLOGs of `Loom/ZkTriangular.lean`, now partially discharged by
the bridge). Pair-resolution extraction is proved exactly as impossible
straightline and exactly as possible with the mask counterfactual — which
game grants that counterfactual is a GAME-PACKAGING question, not an
algebraic one, and is named in `[ZK-RBR-extract]` below with the two open
lemmas that are all that remains of the extraction flank.

/-! ## The mask-augmented extractor: peeling the pair COSTS a mask counterfactual

`[ZK-RBR-interleave]`'s missing lemma 2 asked for the extractor that peels
`(witness, mask)` pairs. Here it is — and its type is the diagnosis: it
consumes `2n + 1` transcripts, the extra `n` at MASK-perturbed schedules
`updSched ηs ηalt k` — counterfactual mask challenges the honest protocol
never runs (the mask challenge is fixed per round). With them, the peel
closes exactly (`extractMaskedPair_sound`); without them it is
information-theoretically impossible (`masked_pair_ambiguous`); and the
without-them extraction that IS possible — masked resolution — is
`maskedChain_knowledge_sound` above. -/

/-- **The mask-augmented pair extractor**: from the base transcript `h₀`, the
`n` link-perturbed transcripts `hlink`, and the `n` MASK-perturbed
transcripts `hmask`, recover round `k`'s `(witness, mask)` pair. The mask is
one field inversion against the mask-coordinate difference (challenge
`γs k · (ηs k − ηalt k)` — the product through which the mask enters the flat
word); the witness is the extracted masked word with the recovered mask
peeled at the public challenge (the `unmask` shape). Straightline: a pure
function of transcript data, no rewinding. -/

`[ZK-RBR-triangular]` (the sibling flank's residual) asked for the bridge
identifying `Loom/ZkTriangular.lean`'s abstract `triFold` with the
mask-augmented chain word. Here is its algebraic half: the masked chain's
`(k+1)`-st partial fold equals `triFold` at the PRODUCT schedule
`δ·η` (link challenge times mask challenge — the coefficient through which
round `k`'s mask actually enters the deployed word), with the real links'
weighted words absorbed into the word family — exactly the absorption
ZkTriangular's header declared legal through the ∀-witness quantifier. With
the bridge, `TriangularHiding` applies VERBATIM to the surface the seam
decodes: one data surface, both games. -/

/-! ## Residual obligation — prose, not a stub

**`[ZK-RBR-extract]`** — the sharpened remainder of `[ZK-RBR-interleave]`'s
missing lemma 2, after this file. The lemma as POSED is resolved: the
mask-coordinate counterfactuals provably cannot be furnished by the honest
execution (`masked_pair_ambiguous` — no function of any δ-schedule family
sees the pair), provably need not be (`maskedChain_knowledge_sound` — masked
words are witnesses, extracted exactly from the δ-family the seam furnishes),
and provably suffice where granted (`extractMaskedPair_sound`); the
quantifier-position confinement is not asserted but exhibited — everything
the extraction game reads is proved simulator-distributed
(`extraction_surface_witness_free`, `mask_image_homTwin`,
`masked_partialFold_hiding`), so the counterfactuals live only in the
extraction game's ∀ and never reach the ZK distinguisher. What remains is
TWO lemmas, named precisely:

* **Open lemma A — the sub-unique-decoding seam.** `seamCounterfactual_sound`
  recovers each round increment from `t ≥ d` opened columns
  (`recoverFromColumns_sound`), and `not_constrainedMask_hiding_of_recoverable`
  proves that regime is INCOMPATIBLE with constrained-mask hiding
  (`t + r ≤ d`) — the homogeneous masks that make masked words witnesses.
  So the deployed constrained-mask protocol needs the increment recovered
  from `t ≤ d − r` columns per round: erasure correction inside the MUTUAL
  AGREEMENT SET across the fold family (WARP App. B's actual route), not
  per-word unique decoding. The open lemma: extend `recoverFromColumns` to
  that regime and re-prove `seamCounterfactual_sound` there. It composes:
  `Loom/CorrelatedAgreement.lean`'s mutual CA (landed at the UD radius),
  `[ERASURE-list]` + `[OOD-pin-proximity]` (the named list-regime seams,
  unchanged), and this file's `seamCounterfactual` / `extractChain_flatFold`
  shapes, which are regime-independent and carry over verbatim. Every other
  step of the masked-resolution route is closed relative to this lemma.
  (The whole-code alternative — hiding AND the UD seam at exactly `t = d`,
  `seam_hiding_coexist_at_d` — trades the conflict away, but then the mask
  shifts the folded targets: the mask claims must ride as links carrying
  their own prover-supplied targets, and extracting THOSE links' witnesses
  is pair-resolution extraction, which `masked_pair_ambiguous` bars from
  the honest execution. The two horns meet in lemma A; there is no third
  route at this file's resolution.)

* **Open lemma B — the masked-resolution game packaging.** The
  `Reduction`/`RbrKnowledgeSoundness` instance owed since
  `[ACC-sound-rbr-game]`, now with its extraction target FIXED by this
  file: the game's `extract` field must output the MASKED words —
  `extractChain` composed with `seamCounterfactual` — not `(witness, mask)`
  pairs. A straightline FS extractor sees ONE mask challenge per
  commitment (re-querying the oracle at the same commitment returns the
  same challenge; a different commitment is a different mask), so the pair
  target would demand exactly the counterfactual `masked_pair_ambiguous`
  rules out; the masked target is met by this file's theorems with the
  landed `accRbrError` as the round price and `RbrZeroKnowledge` as the
  coexisting ZK half (`maskedExtraction_coexists_hiding` is its
  model-level shape). Root attribution rides the same choice: the masked
  words attach to the RECOMMITTED roots — the only words the ZK schedule
  may commit and open, since opening bare witness or mask words refutes
  hiding (`window_F5`'s middle regime is the `t`-side of that fact). This
  file makes "knowledge of the masked words, attributed to the recommitted
  roots" the theorem-backed resolution, not a concession; packaging it into
  the SR/FS game object is the open composition, inherited from
  `[ACC-sound-rbr-game]` and `Loom/RbrZeroKnowledge.lean`'s third bullet.

* **What is NOT at risk.** Every citation is an unconditional landed
  theorem: `extractChain_sound`, `extractPair_sound` (through
  `extractPair_flatFold_snd`), `aggregate_satisfies`,
  `recoverFromColumns_sound` / `committed_word_recovered`'s binding step,
  `mask_bijOn`, `rbrZeroKnowledge_of_rounds`, `triangularHiding_of_rounds`,
  `constrainedMask_hiding`, `rs_maskedOpeningHiding`, `open_determines`.
  The negative results (`masked_pair_ambiguous`,
  `not_constrainedMask_hiding_of_recoverable`,
  `extractMaskedPair_mask_diagonal`) are proofs, not conjectures — the
  frontier is exactly lemmas A and B, and nothing here narrows quietly.

## Ledger

* `maskedWord` / `flatFold` / `foldWords_ofFn` / `flatFold_updSched` /
  `flatFold_congr_single` — DEFINED/PROVED: the masked flat chain word,
  bridged to the landed `foldWords`; one-coordinate perturbation algebra.
* `extractPair_flatFold_snd` / `extractChain_flatFold` — PROVED: the chain
  extractor inverts the honest flat fold EXACTLY, arbitrary depth.
* `mask_sat_of_ker` / `maskedWord_forall₂` / `masked_aggregate_satisfies` —
  PROVED: homogeneous masks preserve the claim chain; masked completeness
  on the real aggregate (`aggregate_satisfies` cited).
* `maskedChain_knowledge_sound` — PROVED: masked-resolution knowledge
  soundness from the δ-family alone — exact extraction + `Forall₂`
  certification; adversarial form is the landed `extractChain_sound`
  verbatim (claim chain unchanged).
* `extracted_openings_are_jointOpen` (`rfl`) /
  `extraction_surface_witness_free` / `homTwin` / `mask_image_homTwin` /
  `extracted_word_witness_free` — PROVED: everything extraction reveals is
  the simulator's object (openings = `jointOpen`, full word uniform on the
  claim's public satisfying set via `mask_bijOn`).
* `extractMaskedPair` (+ `_sound`, `_mask_diagonal`) /
  `MaskedChainExtraction` (+ `_holds`) — DEFINED/PROVED: the pair peel,
  exact given the mask counterfactual; collapses at the mask diagonal; the
  statement's type carries both counterfactual schedules.
* `masked_pair_ambiguous` — PROVED: the pair is invisible to EVERY
  δ-schedule — the mask counterfactual is not a function of the honest
  execution; `single_fold_ambiguous` lifted to the masked chain at full
  quantifier strength.
* `maskedExtraction_coexists_hiding` / `zero_mask_kills_hiding_not_pair` /
  `mask_diagonal_kills_pair_not_hiding` — PROVED: game separation by
  quantifier position, teeth both directions.
* `partialFold` (+ `_zero`, `_succ`, `_last`) / `seamCounterfactual`
  (+ `_sound`) / `extractChain_seamCounterfactual` / `binding_columns` /
  `extractChain_committed_seam` — DEFINED/PROVED: the one-execution seam —
  perturbed transcripts synthesized from opened columns of the recommitted
  partial folds, through binding, extraction included (UD regime, honest
  boundary).
* `seam_hiding_coexist_at_d` / `not_constrainedMask_hiding_of_recoverable`
  — PROVED: the parameter window — whole-code coexistence exactly at
  `t = d`; recovery refutes constrained hiding at every challenge.
* `partialFold_eq_triFold` / `masked_partialFold_hiding` — PROVED: the
  deployment bridge to `triFold` at the product schedule
  (`[ZK-RBR-triangular]`'s algebraic half) + the deployed surface is the
  triangular simulator's surface.
* Keystones — `masked_knowledge_F5`, `masked_extraction_computes`,
  `masked_completeness_F5`, `maskedChainExtraction_F5`,
  `pair_extraction_computes`, `pair_ambiguous_F5`, `ambiguity_computed`,
  `seam_extraction_F5`, `seam_extraction_committed_F5`, `window_F5`,
  `separation_F5`, `zero_mask_F5`, `mask_diagonal_F5`,
  `deployed_surface_F5` — all fired/computed on the landed F₅ instance.
* Residual — `[ZK-RBR-extract]` (prose above): open lemma A (the
  sub-unique-decoding seam via mutual CA) + open lemma B (the
  masked-resolution game packaging); the counterfactual question as posed
  is resolved, with the confinement exhibited, not asserted.
