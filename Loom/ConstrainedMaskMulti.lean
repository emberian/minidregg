# Loom.ConstrainedMaskMulti — `[CMASK-multi]` closed: constrained-mask
surjectivity at GENERAL `r` evaluation constraints.

`Loom/ConstrainedMask.lean` proved constrained-mask surjectivity and hiding for
ONE evaluation constraint (`r = 1`, bound `t + 1 ≤ d`) and named its own
residual `[CMASK-multi]`: general `r` — a mask vanishing at `r` constraint
points — "iterates this file's factorization … giving `t + r ≤ d`". This file
IS that iteration, and it lands at full generality: the `r`-fold vanishing
factor is `Lagrange.nodal` (the monic product `∏ⱼ (X − dom ptⱼ)`, degree
exactly `r`), so the single-factor argument reruns verbatim with the nodal
polynomial in the factor slot — no induction on the constraint list needed,
Mathlib's `degree_nodal` / `eval_nodal_at_node` / `eval_nodal_not_at_node`
carry the bookkeeping the residual predicted.

**The argument (vanishing-product factorization).** A degree-`< d` polynomial
vanishing at the `r` points `dom pt₁, …, dom ptᵣ` factors as
`p = (∏ⱼ (X − dom ptⱼ)) · p'` with `p'` of degree `< d − r`. Choosing `p'` by
Lagrange interpolation through the `t` DESIRED values, each divided by the
vanishing product's value at that query (well-defined: no query point is a
constraint point), makes `p` vanish at every `ptⱼ` AND open to exactly the
target tuple at the `t` queries — using `t + r ≤ d`: `r` of the `d` degrees
of freedom are spent paying for the constraints, `t` remain for the targets.
The `r = 1` proof is literally the special case where the nodal product has
one factor.

**What is proved here:**

* `constrainedMaskSpaceMulti` — `RS ⊓ ⨅ⱼ ker(eval at ptⱼ)`, the mask claim's
  homogeneous kernel for `r` evaluation constraints, a genuine `Submodule`.
  Coherence anchors: at `r = 0` it IS the whole code
  (`constrainedMaskSpaceMulti_zero` — the regime of `exists_codeword_open`),
  at `r = 1` it IS `constrainedMaskSpace`
  (`constrainedMaskSpaceMulti_one` — the file being generalized), and
  `coe_constrainedMaskSpaceMulti` ties it to `ConstrainedCode`'s vocabulary:
  it is `constrainedRS dom d (List.ofFn fun j => evalConstraint (pts j) 0)`.
* `exists_constrainedMaskMulti_open` — **the surjectivity theorem at general
  `r`**: for `t + r ≤ d`, distinct query points none of them a constraint
  point, every `t`-tuple is opened by some mask vanishing at ALL `r`
  constraint points. NOTE the constraint points are NOT required pairwise
  distinct: repeats only repeat a factor in the nodal product (the mask then
  vanishes to higher order), so the theorem as stated is strictly stronger
  than the residual's "r distinct points" phrasing — repeats merely waste
  constraint budget, they never break the construction.
* `constrainedMaskMulti_hiding` — the surjectivity fed through
  `maskedOpeningHiding_of_surj`: `MaskedOpeningHiding` for the `r`-constraint
  mask space at every `γ ≠ 0`, bound `t + r ≤ d`. No re-derivation of
  `ZKHiding.lean`'s fiber/simulator machinery.
* **Keystones over F₅**, `RS[F₅, {0,1,2,3}, 3]` (quadratics over the
  `RSExample` domain — `d = 3` because two constraints need `t + 2 ≤ d`),
  constrained by vanishing at BOTH `pt = 2` and `pt = 3` (`r = 2`): the
  constrained space is the F₅-multiples of `X² + 1` (word `(1, 2, 0, 0)`) —
  `quadWord_mem_multi` inhabits it; `constrainedMaskMulti_surj_F5` fires the
  surjectivity AT the tight bound `t + r = 1 + 2 = d = 3`;
  `constrainedMaskMulti_open_one_F5` is the computed end-to-end witness;
  `not_open_10_constrainedMaskMulti_F5` exhibits an UNREACHABLE tuple at
  `t = 2` (`t + r = 4 > d`) — the bound is load-bearing; and
  `not_open_1_at_constraint_F5` shows the DISJOINTNESS hypothesis is
  load-bearing too — querying a constraint point defeats surjectivity even
  inside the budget `t + r ≤ d`.

**What stays prose-residual — `[CMASK-dual-distance]`:** non-evaluation
LINEAR constraint channels. An arbitrary `LinearConstraint` weight vector not
concentrated at a domain point offers NO vanishing factor to divide out — the
factorization above needs each constraint to BE a point so `(X − dom pt)` is
available. The honest bound there is the dual distance of the constrained
code (a Singleton-type bound on an arbitrary linear code, not interpolation)
— separate, genuinely harder mathematics, named by `ZKHiding.lean`'s original
residual and NOT attempted here.

/-! ## Constrained-mask surjectivity at general `r`: the vanishing-product argument -/

/-- **Constrained-mask surjectivity, general `r`.** For `t + r ≤ d` distinct
query points, none of them a constraint point: every `t`-tuple of symbol
values is opened by SOME mask in the `r`-constraint space — a codeword
vanishing at ALL `r` constraint points AND matching the desired values at the
`t` queries. Vanishing-product factorization:
`p = (∏ⱼ (X − dom (pts j))) · p'` — the product is `Lagrange.nodal`, monic of
degree exactly `r` — with `p'` interpolating the target values scaled by the
product's (nonzero) values at the queries, so `p` has degree
`< r + t ≤ d`, vanishes at every constraint point through the nodal factor,
and opens to `v` because the factor divides out at each query. This closes
`[CMASK-multi]` as stated: the `r = 1` proof is the one-factor special case,
and the constraint points need not even be pairwise distinct (repeated points
repeat a factor — higher-order vanishing, never failure). -/

masked-opening hiding holds when the mask is confined to the kernel of ALL
`r` evaluation constraints, at every `γ ≠ 0` and the bound `t + r ≤ d`. Fed
directly through `maskedOpeningHiding_of_surj`; only the surjectivity premise
is new, the fiber-bijection/simulator machinery is reused. -/

Over `RS[F₅, {0,1,2,3}, 3]` — quadratics `a + bX + cX²` on `RSExample`'s
domain; `d = 3` because two constraints cost two degrees of freedom —
constrained by vanishing at BOTH `pt = 2` and `pt = 3` (`r = 2`): a quadratic
vanishing at `2` and `3` is `c·(X − 2)(X − 3) = c·(X² + 1)` over F₅, so the
constrained space is the F₅-multiples of the word `(1, 2, 0, 0)` — a genuine
1-dimensional subspace (5 codewords out of the 125 quadratic words). -/

/-! ## Residual obligation — prose, not a stub

**`[CMASK-multi]` is CLOSED** — at full generality, not an `r = 2` slice:
`exists_constrainedMaskMulti_open` proves the surjectivity for EVERY `r`
(the nodal product carries the whole induction the r = 1 file predicted,
pre-packaged by Mathlib's `Lagrange.nodal` bookkeeping), the bound `t + r ≤ d`
exhibited BOTH tight (satisfiable at `t + r = d` on the F₅ keystone) and
load-bearing (refuted one query past it), the disjointness hypothesis also
exhibited load-bearing (a query AT a constraint point is refuted inside the
budget), and the surjectivity feeds through the existing reduction to genuine
`MaskedOpeningHiding` for the `r`-constraint space
(`constrainedMaskMulti_hiding`). No `[CMASK-multi-ind]` residual is needed:
nothing about general `r` was deferred.

**`[CMASK-dual-distance]`** — what genuinely remains, inherited verbatim from
the `r = 1` file and `ZKHiding.lean`: NON-EVALUATION linear constraint
channels. A general `LinearConstraint` weight vector `a` (not concentrated at
a domain point) admits no vanishing factor — there is no point `pt` with
`(X − dom pt)` to divide out, so the factorization above simply does not
start. The honest bound for the opening map's surjectivity on
`RS ⊓ ker(⟨a, ·⟩)` is the DUAL DISTANCE of the constrained code — a
Singleton-type bound on an arbitrary linear code, separate and harder
mathematics than interpolation. Open, named, not attempted, not faked.
