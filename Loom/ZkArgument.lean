# Loom.ZkArgument — [OB-4-hiding-rbr] gap (2): hiding and knowledge-soundness
coexisting in ONE straightline argument.

`Loom/AccExtract.lean` built the straightline knowledge extractor for the
γ-fold (`extractPair`, needs the mask PEELABLE — two accepting transcripts at
distinct challenges). `Loom/ZKHiding.lean` + `Loom/ConstrainedMask.lean` built
the opening simulator (`MaskedOpeningHiding`, needs the mask to HIDE — a
uniform, witness-free opened tuple from ONE transcript). Read naively these
pull opposite directions: an extractor "sees through" the mask across two
runs while a simulator must show ONE run leaks nothing. This file states and
composes a single object, `ZkArgument`, that carries BOTH properties (plus
completeness) for the masked accumulator claim, and proves they coexist
NON-VACUOUSLY on one built instance — the tension resolves at the level of
QUANTIFIER POSITION, not by weakening either property:

* **Knowledge-soundness** ranges over a CHEATING PROVER's choice of a SECOND
  challenge `γ'` and a second accepting transcript `h'` — `∀ {h h' γ'}, γ ≠
  γ' → …`. Extraction is a fact about PAIRS of transcripts.
* **Zero-knowledge** is a fact about ONE transcript at the fixed challenge
  `γ` — `MaskedOpeningHiding M q γ` mentions no `γ'` at all, because the
  honest verifier the simulator fools never sees a second run.

Nothing in `MaskedOpeningHiding`'s statement depends on `A`, `B`, `foldRoot`,
or `extractPair`; nothing in `accKnowledgeSound`'s conclusion depends on the
query `q`. The two properties are proved from DISJOINT premises
(`Loom/AccExtract.lean`'s fold algebra vs. `Loom/ZKHiding.lean`'s MDS
interpolation) and combine into one structure by straight conjunction — the
NEW content here is exhibiting that combination non-vacuously: a single mask
draw that is simultaneously (a) a valid completeness witness
(`foldClaims_satisfies`), (b) exactly recovered by `extractPair` from two
transcripts, and (c) hidden by `MaskedOpeningHiding` at either transcript
alone. The keystones below build exactly that triple-witness instance, and
the teeth exhibit the properties genuinely pulling apart: at `γ = 0`
extraction still works but hiding is refuted (hiding is the binding
constraint, not knowledge); with only ONE transcript, extraction is
information-theoretically impossible (`single_fold_ambiguous`-style) while
hiding of that same transcript still holds (zero-knowledge needs no second
run).

**The bridge this file supplies.** `Loom/ZK.lean`'s `mask_bijOn` draws the
mask from `satWords C B` — the mask CLAIM's satisfying set (an `AccClaim`,
the vocabulary the fold algebra speaks). `Loom/ConstrainedMask.lean`'s
`constrainedMask_hiding` speaks of `constrainedMaskSpace dom d pt` — a
`Submodule` (the vocabulary the reduction theorem `maskedOpeningHiding_of_surj`
needs). For a single-evaluation-constraint mask claim (weight `evalAtPt pt`,
target `0`) these are the SAME set, pointwise
(`mem_constrainedMaskSpace_iff_satisfies`) — the object `Loom/AccExtract.lean`
peels is, on the nose, the object `Loom/ZKHiding.lean`/`Loom/ConstrainedMask.lean`
hide. That identification is what lets one `ZkArgument` instance cite both
without re-deriving either.

**Honest scope — what closes and what is `[ZK-RBR-game]`.** Every field of
`ZkArgument` is proved by CITATION (no re-derivation): completeness from
`foldClaims_satisfies`, knowledge-soundness from `accKnowledgeSound`,
zero-knowledge from `constrainedMask_hiding` (which itself rides
`maskedOpeningHiding_of_surj`). This closes gap (2) at the SINGLE-STEP,
SINGLE-ROUND level: one fold, one query set, one pair of challenges. What
remains — the full RBR-game instance where EVERY round of a depth-`k`
accumulation chain is simultaneously extractable (two-point, chain-level,
per `Loom/AccSoundRbr.lean`'s `[ACC-sound-rbr-game]` diagnosis) and
simulatable (fresh per-round masks, per `Loom/ZKHiding.lean`'s named
multi-step-schedule residual), with the two obligations interleaved across
`k` rounds without either compromising the other — is named precisely at the
bottom, `[ZK-RBR-game]`. It is NOT faked here: no `Reduction` /
`RbrKnowledgeSoundness` pair is built, and no RBR-shaped zero-knowledge
vocabulary exists yet in `Loom/Rbr.lean` to even state the round-level
simulator obligation in that game's terms. What this file closes is real and
non-trivial (the single-round coexistence, proved, keystoned, and given
teeth); what is open is a genuinely new composition, sharpened below.
No `sorry`, no vacuous `Prop := True`.

the claim's satisfying set (what `Loom/ZK.lean`'s `mask_bijOn` draws from) is
membership in `constrainedMaskSpace dom d pt` (what
`Loom/ConstrainedMask.lean`'s `constrainedMask_hiding` hides). Pointwise, so it
transports through either direction without a `Set`-coercion detour. -/

/-! ## `ZkArgument` — completeness, knowledge-soundness, zero-knowledge, one
structure

Each field's type is the REAL conclusion of the theorem it will be built
from, instantiated on the masked accumulator claim `foldClaims foldRoot A B
γ` with mask space `M` (the object `Loom/ZK.lean`'s fold and
`Loom/ZKHiding.lean`'s opening both draw from — the bridge above supplies a
concrete `M` for which that is literally true). Nothing here is a
restatement in weaker form: `knowledge_sound`'s conclusion is
`accKnowledgeSound`'s four-way conjunction verbatim; `zero_knowledge` is
`MaskedOpeningHiding` verbatim. -/

/-- **`ZkArgument`** — a zero-knowledge argument for the accumulator's γ-fold,
at ONE step: the running claim `A` folds the mask claim `B` (mask space `M`)
at challenge `γ`, under the query `q`. -/

  /-- **Completeness**: an honest witness `f` of the running claim, masked by
  ANY `g` drawn from the mask space `M` that also satisfies `B`'s shared

  /-- **Knowledge-soundness**: for ANY second challenge `γ'` a cheating
  prover chooses and ANY second accepting transcript `h'` it produces, the
  straightline extractor `extractPair` recovers genuine witnesses of the
  INDIVIDUAL claims from the pair `(h, h')` — `accKnowledgeSound`'s
  conclusion verbatim. Quantified over TWO transcripts: this is where a
  cheating prover's choices live. -/

  /-- **Zero-knowledge**: the `t` symbols the verifier opens of the masked
  transcript AT `γ` — the ONE transcript the honest verifier ever runs — are
  simulatable without the witness. No second challenge appears in this
  field's type: that absence, contrasted with `knowledge_sound`'s `γ'`, IS
  the quantifier-position separation the module header names. -/

/-- **The coexistence theorem**: `ZkArgument` fires by straight composition
of three cited theorems, given only the mask-space bridge `hMB` (the mask
space `M` really is `B`'s satisfying set — supplied for the constrained-mask
case by `mem_constrainedMaskSpace_iff_satisfies` above) and the opening-hiding
fact `hZK` itself. Nothing here is re-derived: `completeness` is
`foldClaims_satisfies`, `knowledge_sound` is `accKnowledgeSound`,
`zero_knowledge` is exactly `hZK`. The NEW content is that these three
citations discharge the SAME structure's three fields on the SAME `(C,
foldRoot, A, B, M, q, γ)` — the coexistence is definitional, not a new
inequality to prove, once the bridge identifies the two mask-space
vocabularies. -/

/-! ### Teeth: the two properties genuinely pull opposite directions

Neither is a restatement of the other, exhibited both ways. -/

/-- **Teeth 1** — hiding is the binding constraint, not knowledge: at `γ =
0`, zero-knowledge is REFUTED (`not_maskedOpeningHiding_zero`; the query is
nonempty, `t = 1 > 0`), so no `ZkArgument` exists at `γ = 0`. Knowledge is
NOT what fails: `extractPair` still recovers the honest pair from folds at
`0` and any `γ' ≠ 0` — computed directly on `accKnowledgeSound`'s underlying
algebra, with no `ZkArgument` instance in sight (there is none to cite). -/
theorem zeroKnowledge_fails_at_zero :

      = (xWord, ZkHidingExample.lineOf 2 1) := by
  decide

/-- **Teeth 2** — one transcript is never enough for knowledge, but IS
enough for hiding: two genuinely DISTINCT witness pairs — `(xWord, lineOf 2
1)` and `(twoWord, 0)` (`ZkExample.twoWord`, the constant-`2` codeword,
satisfies `evalA`; the zero codeword trivially satisfies `Bmask`) — fold to
the SAME word `twoWord` at the single challenge `γ = 1`
(`xWord + lineOf 2 1 = twoWord = twoWord + 0`, computed). No function of one
fold recovers `(f, g)`; `single_fold_ambiguous` (`Loom/AccExtract.lean`) is
this phenomenon in general, exhibited here on the SAME claim pair
`zkArgument_F5` uses. -/
theorem single_fold_ambiguous_masked :
    ∃ f₁ g₁ f₂ g₂ : Fin 4 → ZMod 5,
      (f₁, g₁) ≠ (f₂, g₂) ∧

/-- **Zero-knowledge survives the ambiguity**: the very fold at `γ = 1` that
`single_fold_ambiguous_masked` shows no extractor can invert is STILL hidden
— `zero_knowledge` fires there. One transcript is never enough to extract,
but is exactly what zero-knowledge is a statement about. -/

/-! ## Residual obligation — prose, not a stub

**`[ZK-RBR-game]`** — the full RBR-game instance in which EVERY round of a
depth-`k` accumulation chain is simultaneously extractable and simulatable,
composed over depth. What `ZkArgument` closes above is the single-round,
single-query-set slice: one fold, one pair of challenges for extraction, one
challenge and one query set for hiding — real, and now built on a concrete
non-vacuous instance with teeth. What `[ZK-RBR-game]` needs beyond that,
named precisely (not faked):

* **A round-level object that carries BOTH obligations, and does not exist
  yet.** `Loom/Rbr.lean`'s `RbrKnowledgeSoundness` (WARP Def 4.2) is the
  ONLY round-level vocabulary this codebase has — an `extract` field and an
  `err` bound, nothing zero-knowledge-shaped. There is no
  `RbrZeroKnowledge`-style structure pairing a per-round SIMULATOR with a
  per-round hiding bound in `Rbr.lean`'s idiom (challenge-indexed,
  `uniformProb`-measured). Authoring that vocabulary — not just
  instantiating it — is part of this residual: `MaskedOpeningHiding` is
  stated over ONE query set and ONE challenge; casting it as a round-level
  RBR object (a `uniformProb`-measured simulator-success bound, dual to
  `Loom/AccSoundRbr.lean`'s `accRbrError`) is unbuilt.
* **The chain-level extractor is two-point; the naive per-round shape is
  one-point — `Loom/AccSoundRbr.lean`'s `[ACC-sound-rbr-game]` diagnosis,
  inherited verbatim.** WARP Def 4.2's backward round extractor is seeded
  from a SINGLE extended transcript; `extractPair` (this file's
  `knowledge_sound`, cited unchanged) needs TWO. `Loom/AccSoundRbr.lean`
  proved that the naive one-transcript embedding does NOT discharge
  `RbrKnowledgeSoundness.extract_sound` for the fold (the linear code's
  kernel makes closeness of the SUM say nothing about closeness of the
  SUMMANDS without the mutual-correlated-agreement structure) and named the
  realizer as the CHAIN-level two-point extractor
  (`Loom/AccExtractChain.lean`'s `extractChain`), not a single-round fix.
  `[ZK-RBR-game]` inherits this obstruction unchanged: whatever `extract`
  field the new `k`-round `Reduction` carries must be the chain extractor,
  not `k` independent one-round extractors.
* **The genuinely NEW coupling this file's residual adds** (absent from
  `[ACC-sound-rbr-game]`, which is extraction-only, and from
  `Loom/ZKHiding.lean`'s named "multi-step schedule" piece, which is
  hiding-only): the chain extractor's SECOND transcript per round — in
  deployment, the `t` opened columns plus erasure correction
  (`[ACC-extract-bind]`, `AccExtract.lean`'s module header) — and the
  simulator's PER-ROUND mask draw must be shown NOT to interfere across `k`
  rounds. Concretely: the erasure-corrected second evaluation that furnishes
  `extractPair`'s `h'` at round `i` is read off the SAME opened columns the
  round-`i` simulator must also produce (honestly) or hide (against a
  distinguisher) — one straightline FS execution, one set of openings,
  serving both a soundness reduction that runs the chain extractor over ALL
  rounds' output-prefix queries (WARP Thm B.4's SR game, `Loom/Depth.lean`)
  and a zero-knowledge reduction that must simulate those SAME openings
  without the witness, round by round. Whether FRESH per-round masks
  (`Loom/ZKHiding.lean`'s residual: "that each committed word is opened at
  ONE step only is what should make fresh per-step masks sufficient") are
  enough to make the two reductions independent, or whether the chain
  extractor's cross-round algebra (`extractPair_peel₂`'s `wAt` recursion)
  creates a real coupling a fresh-mask argument does not automatically kill,
  is the open mathematical question — genuinely open, not bureaucratic.
* **What is NOT at risk.** Nothing above casts doubt on either landed
  bound: `accRbrError`/`accSound_rbr` (`Loom/AccSoundRbr.lean`) and
  `MaskedOpeningHiding`/`rs_maskedOpeningHiding`/`constrainedMask_hiding`
  (`Loom/ZKHiding.lean`, `Loom/ConstrainedMask.lean`) are real, unconditional
  theorems this file cites without re-derivation. The obstruction is
  entirely in ASSEMBLING a `k`-round game object whose OWN
  `extract_sound`/simulator fields refine into (imply) those per-round
  bounds AND coexist with each other across depth — the same
  bureaucratic-looking-but-substantive gap `[ACC-sound-rbr-game]` names for
  extraction alone, now doubled by a genuinely new interleaving question on
  the hiding side.

What THIS file closes: gap (2) of `[OB-4-hiding-rbr]` at the single-round
level — `ZkArgument` bundles completeness, knowledge-soundness, and
zero-knowledge as one `Prop`, built by straight composition from
`foldClaims_satisfies`, `accKnowledgeSound`, and `constrainedMask_hiding`
with no re-derivation, non-vacuous on a concrete F₅ instance where all THREE
fire on the SAME transcript (`completeness_fired`, `knowledge_sound_fired`,
`zero_knowledge_fired`), and with teeth in BOTH directions
(`zeroKnowledge_fails_at_zero` + `extraction_survives_at_zero`;
`single_fold_ambiguous_masked` + `zeroKnowledge_holds_at_one`) showing the
two properties are independent, not one a shadow of the other. The
quantifier-position argument that RESOLVES the apparent tension —
knowledge-soundness quantifies over a cheating prover's SECOND transcript,
zero-knowledge is a fact about the ONE transcript the honest verifier runs —
is visible directly in `ZkArgument`'s two field types, not asserted only in
prose. `[ZK-RBR-game]` — the multi-round game composing both — remains
genuinely open, sharpened above to a specific coupling question between the
chain extractor's opened-column source and the per-round simulator's mask
draws, not a restatement of either `[ACC-sound-rbr-game]` or `Loom/ZKHiding.lean`'s
residuals in isolation.
