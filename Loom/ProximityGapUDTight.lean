# Loom.ProximityGapUDTight — `[PROXGAP-tight]`(a): the BCIKS Berlekamp–Welch-
over-`F(Z)` route to the FULL unique-decoding radius `(1 − ρ)/2`, built to its
one genuinely-hard rung.

**What this file is.** `Loom/ProximityGapUD.lean` PROVED the RS proximity gap
on `δ ∈ (0, (1 − ρ)/3)` and named the residual `[PROXGAP-tight]`(a): the
elementary transfer pays a `2δ` start cost, and the full radius is BCIKS
2020/654 Thm 4.1 — run the Berlekamp–Welch decoder over the rational function
field `K = F(Z)` on the received word `w(x) = u₀(x) + Z·u₁(x)`. This file
BUILDS that route. Following BCIKS §4.3 (read against the actual paper, ECCC
TR20-083):

1. *The interpolation system, SOLVED* (`exists_bw_solution`): nonzero
   `A, B ∈ F[Z][X]` with `deg_X A ≤ e`, `deg_Z A ≤ e`, `deg_X B ≤ n − e − 1`,
   `deg_Z B ≤ e + 1` and `A(xᵢ, Z)·(u₀(xᵢ) + Z·u₁(xᵢ)) = B(xᵢ, Z)` at every
   domain point, with `A ≠ 0`. BCIKS obtain this from Cramer's rule after
   showing every maximal minor of the system matrix — a degree-`≤ e + 1`
   polynomial in `Z` — vanishes on the `> n` close challenges (their
   "`≤ n` bad-challenge count"). Here the SAME degree profile is obtained
   UNCONDITIONALLY: padding `deg_X B` to `n − e − 1` (the largest degree the
   uniqueness step tolerates) makes the coefficient space exceed the
   constraint space by EXACTLY one F-dimension — `(e+1)² + (n−e)(e+2) =
   n(e+2) + 1` — so a nonzero solution exists by rank-nullity, no minors
   needed. The `|S| > n` threshold is NOT thereby dodged: it reappears as the
   third Polishchuk–Spielman inequality below, which is where BCIKS's proof
   spends it too (their minor argument only fed existence).
2. *Specialization* (`bw_specialize`, `bw_quotient_at`): at every close
   challenge `z` with `A(X, z) ≠ 0`, the specialized pair is a Berlekamp–
   Welch solution for the close word, hence `B(X, z) = A(X, z)·p_z` for THE
   close codeword `p_z` — root counting on `A(X,z)·p_z − B(X,z)` (degree
   `≤ n − e − 1`, vanishing on `≥ n − e` agreement points; the step that
   prices the FULL radius: it needs only `2e + d ≤ n`, i.e. δ up to
   `(1 − ρ)/2`, not the elementary route's `3e + d ≤ n`). At `z` with
   `A(X, z) = 0`, `B(X, z)` vanishes on the whole domain and is 0. Either
   way `A(X, z) ∣ B(X, z)` for EVERY close `z`.
3. *The one hard rung, named* (`PolishchukSpielman`, `[PROXGAP-BW-ps]`):
   BCIKS Lemma 4.4 — the Polishchuk–Spielman bivariate divisibility lemma
   ([Spi95] Lemma 4.2.18 after the eprint's Appendix-D reduction): from
   `A(x, Z) ∣ B(x, Z)` on `n_X` columns, `A(X, z) ∣ B(X, z)` on `n_Z` rows,
   and the three degree inequalities (the third is EXACTLY where `|S| > n`
   is spent, and is what prices `err = n/|F|`), conclude `A ∣ B` in
   `F[X, Z]`. Carried as the HYPOTHESIS `hPS`, stated in full precision as
   a `Prop` about bivariate polynomials — real content, its premises PROVED
   inhabited at a concrete instance below, never assumed, never `True`.
4. *The assembly, PROVED from the quotient* (inside
   `correlatedAgreement_of_close_card_full`): `P := B/A` has `deg_X P < d`
   (its high coefficients — Z-polynomials of degree ≤ e + 1, by the
   Z-degree-of-quotient lemma `ZDegLE.of_mul_left` — vanish on `> e + 1`
   specializations), `P` reproduces the received line on the `≥ n − e`
   domain points where `A(x, Z) ≠ 0`, and Lagrange interpolation through
   `d` of them forces `P = v₀ + Z·v₁` with `v₀, v₁` HONEST codewords —
   correlated agreement of `(u₀, u₁)` on ONE set of `≥ (1 − δ)n` points.

**The heads.** `rs_proximityGap_UD_full` — the two-case gap at
`d < (1 − 2δ)·n` (the FULL unique-decoding band, vs the landed
`(1 − 3δ)·n`) with the SAME `err = n/|F|`; `reedSolomonCode_isProximityGenerator_UD_full`
(`B = (1 + ρ)/2` — Cor 4.11's printed constant, no longer `(2 + ρ)/3`);
`hasMutualCorrelatedAgreement_UD_full` (mutual CA on all of UD);
`foldDistancePreserving_UD_full`. ALL carry `hPS` explicitly: covered scope
in the same sentence as the claim — the full-band gap is PROVED MODULO the
Polishchuk–Spielman lemma, and `(1 − ρ)/3` remains the unconditional floor
(`Loom/ProximityGapUD.lean`, untouched, still the realizer consumers use).

**Honest scope limits.** (i) Nothing here is unconditional beyond what is
itemized in the ledger: the BW system + its solution, the specialization
quotients, the Z-degree calculus, the quotient assembly, and the numeric
teeth are PROVED; the single named gap is `[PROXGAP-BW-ps]`. (ii) The
residual is REAL mathematics with a real proof in the literature (resultants
+ derivative-of-determinant multiplicities + Gauss's lemma — [Spi95]
pp. 94–98); it is carried as a hypothesis precisely because that proof is a
formalization project of its own, not because it is doubtful. (iii) `ℓ = 2`
(the affine pair generator), as everywhere in the landed stack.

inhabited (`PSExample` below); its own proof — [Spi95] Lemma 4.2.18 via

lemma, reduced to here exactly as in BCIKS 2020/654 Appendix D — is real

for every `x` in a set `SX`, `A(X, z) ∣ B(X, z)` in `F[X]` for every `z` in

`bX/|SX| + bZ/|SZ| < 1` (cleared: `bX·|SZ| + bZ·|SX| < |SX|·|SZ|`), then
`A ∣ B` in `F[Z][X]`. Condition (3) is EXACTLY where the `|S| > n` challenge

/-! ## Keystones (ATLAS law 2: satisfiable + teeth + premise inhabitation)

The landed `RS[F₅, {0,1,2,3}, 2]` (ρ = 1/2). The full-UD band at this code is
`δ ∈ (0, 1/4)`; the landed unconditional band is `(0, 1/6)`. δ = 1/5 sits
STRICTLY BETWEEN — the extension is macroscopic even at the toy. What the
keystones exhibit:

* **the band widens for real** (`band_widens`, UNCONDITIONAL): at δ = 1/5 the
  landed hypothesis `d < (1 − 3δ)n` FAILS and the full-band hypothesis
  `d < (1 − 2δ)n` HOLDS — the new theorem speaks where the old is silent.
* **the Berlekamp–Welch system FIRES** (`bw_solution_F5`, UNCONDITIONAL): the
  proved existence theorem delivers a nonzero solution with the BCIKS degree
  profile at the concrete code — premise inhabitation for everything
  downstream of the system.
* **the residual's premises are inhabitable** (`ps_premises_inhabited`,
  UNCONDITIONAL): a concrete bivariate pair over F₅ satisfies EVERY premise
  of `[PROXGAP-BW-ps]` with the conclusion checkable — the hypothesis
  quantifies over a nonempty domain; assuming it is not vacuous.
* **conditional end-to-end** (`good_line_CA_fullBand`): given `hPS`, the
  all-codeword line has correlated agreement at δ = 1/5 — OUTSIDE the landed
  band — through the full pipeline (system → specialization → quotient →
  interpolation). -/

/-! ## Residual obligation — `[PROXGAP-BW-ps]`, prose not stub

What CLOSED here (all UNCONDITIONAL):

* `exists_bw_solution` — the Berlekamp–Welch interpolation system over
  `F[Z]` has a nonzero solution with EXACTLY the BCIKS degree profile
  (`deg_X A ≤ e`, `deg_Z A ≤ e`, `deg_X B < n − e`, `deg_Z B ≤ e + 1`,
  `A ≠ 0`), by rank-nullity on the padded system — the step BCIKS obtain
  from the vanishing of every maximal minor (a degree-`≤ e + 1` polynomial
  in `Z` killed by `> e + 1` close challenges). The padding to
  `deg_X B < n − e` makes existence free and moves the ENTIRE `|S| > n`
  budget into Polishchuk–Spielman condition (3), where BCIKS's own proof
  spends it; the task-brief's "nonzero maximal minor of degree ≤ n" rank
  lemma is thereby OBVIATED, not skipped — no minor is needed by any
  surviving step.
* `bw_quotient_at` / `bw_specialize` / `map_evalRingHom_eval` — every close
  challenge's specialization is a BW solution and yields the close codeword
  as exact quotient (`B(X,z) = A(X,z)·p_z`); every close challenge gives
  `A(X,z) ∣ B(X,z)` (zero specializations vanish identically). The radius
  arithmetic here is `2e + d ≤ n` — the FULL `(1 − ρ)/2`, the whole point.
* `ZDegLE` calculus with `ZDegLE.of_mul_left` — the Z-degree of a factor is
  bounded by the product's (top Z-slices multiply in a domain): the honest
  version of BCIKS's silent "the quotient has `deg_Z ≤ e + 1`".

  X-degree trim of the quotient by specialization counting, line
  reproduction on the `≥ n − e` good domain points, Lagrange interpolation
  pinning `P = v₀ + Z·v₁`, coefficientwise extraction to ONE common
  agreement set of `≥ (1 − δ)n` coordinates — given `hPS`.
* The four heads (`rs_proximityGap_UD_full`,
  `reedSolomonCode_isProximityGenerator_UD_full` at `B = (1 + ρ)/2`,
  `hasMutualCorrelatedAgreement_UD_full`, `foldDistancePreserving_UD_full`)
  — each PROVED from `hPS`, with the landed Lemma 4.10 / fold reductions
  CITED, not re-derived.
* Keystones — `band_widens` (the extension is macroscopic at the toy,
  unconditionally), `bw_solution_F5` (the system fires), 
  `ps_premises_inhabited` (the residual's premise set is nonvacuous),
  `good_line_CA_fullBand` (conditional end-to-end at δ = 1/5 ∉ old band).

What REMAINS — exactly ONE statement, named:

* **`[PROXGAP-BW-ps]`: `PolishchukSpielman F`** — BCIKS 2020/654 Lemma 4.4,
  i.e. [Spi95] Lemma 4.2.18 after the Appendix-D degree reduction: bivariate
  divisibility from row/column divisibility under the three degree
  inequalities. Its literature proof: WLOG `gcd(A, B) = 1` (divide by the
  gcd, restricting to the rows/columns where it survives — the parameter sum
  only shrinks); then view `A, B ∈ F(x)[y]`, form the Sylvester resultant
  `R(x)` (nonzero by coprimality + Gauss's lemma), show each of the `n_X`
  column points is a root of multiplicity `≥ deg_Z A · …` via the
  derivative-of-determinant expansion (the specialized system rows are
  dependent, so every determinant in the expansion of `R^{(k)}` keeps rank
  deficit until `k` reaches the row count), and the multiplicity count
  exceeds `deg R` — contradiction. Formalization-sized subprojects: Sylvester
  matrices/resultants over `F[x]`, Hasse-derivative (or row-divisibility)
  multiplicity bounds for determinants of polynomial matrices, coprime-lift
  via Gauss's lemma, and the gcd-reduction bookkeeping. REAL future work; the
  hypothesis is never instantiated by an axiom or a `True`-stub anywhere in
  this tree, and every theorem above states it explicitly in its signature.

Downstream: NOTHING in the landed tree consumes `hPS` silently — the
unconditional floor remains `Loom/ProximityGapUD.lean`'s `(1 − ρ)/3`
realizer, and the consumers keep firing on that band exactly as before. When
`[PROXGAP-BW-ps]` is discharged, the four heads above make every hPG
consumer hypothesis-free on ALL of UD with `err = n/|F|`, and
`[PROXGAP-tight]`(a) closes.

(`hPS` is a HYPOTHESIS, visible in every signature that needs it, not an
axiom.) -/
