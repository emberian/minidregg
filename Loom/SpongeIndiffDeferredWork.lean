# Loom.SpongeIndiffDeferredWork — work-indexed deferred ideal semantics

The prefix hybrid samples every construction prefix eagerly.  The ideal world
answers only the public construction query and defers hidden prefix samples
until a primitive query actually reveals them.  Both worlds nevertheless need
one fixed sample space indexed by total primitive work.

This module supplies the missing operational ideal side on exactly that space.
Every public round consumes its full primitive-work segment, but the deferred
ideal step uses only the segment's first pair.  For a construction this pair's
rate answers the full-message RO query and the rest of the segment is hidden
slack; for a primitive query the same pair supplies both the only branch-relevant
rate sample and the primitive capacity sample.  The step is definitionally the
landed `idealStep` under a constant current-round coin assignment.

No distributional equality is asserted here.  The eager construction must
reindex the work vector so its full-prefix rate coin moves to the deferred
segment head and each later reveal receives the corresponding earlier hidden
prefix coin.  `SpongeIndiffUniformCoupling` is the probability transport once
that adaptive bijection and the off-bad agreement proof are constructed.
