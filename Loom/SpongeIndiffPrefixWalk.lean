# Loom.SpongeIndiffPrefixWalk — successful programming materializes the walk

`programPrefixes` returns a final primitive table and state.  The output theorem
already identifies the returned rate with the full-message lazy RO lookup.
This module proves the complementary construction fact: the final primitive
table actually contains the whole programmed/hit path, and walking the input
message from the supplied starting state reaches exactly the returned state.

The proof is insensitive to later log extension.  A first edge—whether it was
already present or freshly programmed—survives every recursive prefix step by
the landed oracle frame law.  Thus the theorem covers arbitrary nonempty
multi-block construction and primitive-first reconciliation, not merely the
two-block executable witness.
