# Loom.HalfThresholdRegime — a proved post-Johnson route with one threshold halving

The 2024 WHIR roadmap treated same-threshold mutual correlated agreement near
capacity as a conjectural route.  The literature changed materially in 2025--26:

* capacity-level plain Reed--Solomon proximity/MCA conjectures were refuted;
* MCA up to Johnson was proved (Bordage--Chiesa--Guan--Manzur, ePrint
  2025/2051; Haboeck, ePrint 2025/2110); and
* Chai--Fan (ePrint 2026/858) gave an unconditional route *above* Johnson by
  halving the distance threshold once, then returning to the classical
  unique-decoding proximity gap in later rounds.

This file formalizes the algebraic heart of the third route directly in Loom's
vocabulary.  For every linear code, if the pair `(f0,f1)` has no correlated
agreement at radius `delta`, then at most one scalar `gamma` makes
`f0 + gamma*f1` `delta/2`-close to the code.  Under the uniform affine
generator the bad mass is therefore at most `1/|F|`.

This theorem is characteristic-agnostic and therefore applies to both the
multiplicative fold and the additive GF(2)-tower fold once their respective
two-point decomposition/coupling lemmas identify the pair.  The local additive
transform and fold algebra are already in `Theory/AdditiveNTT*.lean`; the
remaining protocol assembly is `[HALF-FRI-assemble]`.

The proof is the direct 2x2 solve attributed to Raghavendra--Wootters (STOC
2013), in the exact half-threshold form used by Chai--Fan.  No Johnson list
bound, Reed--Solomon structure, or conjecture is required here.

/-! ## Two close folds force correlated agreement of the pair -/

/-- Two distinct `delta/2`-close points on the affine fold line force the
underlying pair to have correlated agreement at radius `delta`.

The witnesses `u1,u2` are solved back to codewords

`g1 = (gamma1-gamma2)^-1 * (u1-u2)` and
`g0 = u1 - gamma1*g1`.

The two agreement sets each cover a `(1-delta/2)` fraction; their intersection
covers `(1-delta)`, and on it the 2x2 system identifies both source words. -/

## Honest boundary

* **Closed:** the characteristic-independent 2x2 solve, the at-most-one bad
  scalar theorem, the exact `1/|F|` probability price, and a nonempty F5
  instance.
* **`[HALF-FRI-assemble]`:** connect Loom's multiplicative or additive fold
  decomposition to the pair premise, apply this bound once, then use the
  landed UD proximity theorem without compounding the threshold.  Add the
  query miss term `(1-delta/2)^q` and transcript/FS composition.
* **Johnson/MCA status:** `WHIRConjecture412` remains a useful historical
  statement type, but it is no longer literature-open through Johnson:
  ePrint 2025/2051 and 2025/2110 establish that regime.  Capacity-level
  versions are false; post-Johnson positive regimes use different bounds or
  restrictions.  Formalizing those newer full theorems remains separate.
