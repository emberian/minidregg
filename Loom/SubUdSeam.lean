# Loom.SubUdSeam — [ZK-RBR-extract] open lemma A attacked: the SUB-UNIQUE-
DECODING seam. The lemma as POSED (extend `recoverFromColumns` to `t < d`)
is REFUTED in its column form and REALIZED in its mutual-CA form; the
remainder sharpens to `[SUBUD-johnson]`.

`Loom/ZkExtraction.lean` named lemma A exactly: the seam recovers each round
increment from `t ≥ d` opened columns (`recoverFromColumns_sound`), but that
regime is INCOMPATIBLE with constrained-mask hiding (`t + r ≤ d`,
`not_constrainedMask_hiding_of_recoverable`) — the two demands never share a
`t`. The deployed constrained-mask protocol therefore needs the increment
recovered from `t < d` columns per round, "via erasure correction inside the
MUTUAL AGREEMENT SET across the fold family (WARP App. B's actual route),
not per-word unique decoding". This file builds that route. The finding:

**The `t`-window conflict was an artifact of the COLUMN-resolution decoder,
and it DISSOLVES at word resolution — the recovery never counts columns.**

* **The recovery ladder, each rung proved.** The seam's data is the
  correlated fold family `foldFamily f₀ g ρ = f₀ + ρ • g` (successive
  recommitted partial folds ARE this shape — `partialFold_foldFamily`,
  citing `partialFold_succ`):
  1. ONE fold word pins NOTHING about the increment: every candidate `g'`
     is consistent with any observed single fold
     (`single_fold_word_ambiguous`).
  2. TWO exact fold words pin the increment COMPLETELY — this is the landed
     two-point extractor, cited not re-derived (`extractPair_foldFamily`,
     via `extractPair_snd`).
  3. `t < d` COLUMNS of the family — even at EVERY challenge at once — pin
     NOTHING: two distinct codeword increments produce IDENTICAL column
     tables for the whole family, so NO extractor consuming column data
     alone can recover both (`foldFamily_columns_ambiguous`,
     `no_column_extractor` — quantified over ALL recovery functions). The
     posed "extend `recoverFromColumns` to `t < d`" is impossible AS A
     FUNCTION OF COLUMNS; more challenges at the same `t` positions never
     escape `recoverFromColumns_teeth`'s ambiguity.
  4. The δ-CLOSE family plus correlated agreement pins the increment's
     CODEWORD: if the fold at a random challenge is δ-close to the code
     often enough (`err δ < Pr`), the pair `(f₀, g)` agrees with codewords
     `(u₀, u_g)` on ONE common set of ≥ `(1−δ)n` coordinates
     (`foldFamily_correlatedAgreement`, firing the `IsProximityGenerator`
     hypothesis on the tuple `![f₀, g]` — the fold family IS the affine
     generator's combination, `foldFamily_eq_comb`), and below the
     unique-decoding radius `δ < dC/2` that codeword is UNIQUE
     (`subUdRecover_sound`, via the landed `codeword_eq_of_close_of_close`
     + `reedSolomonCode_minDist`, cited). The mutual-CA refinement is the
     landed WHIR Lemma 4.10/Corollary 4.11 cited verbatim
     (`foldFamily_mutualCA` = `reedSolomonCode_hasMutualCorrelatedAgreement`
     at `![f₀, g]`), and per NON-FAILING seed the observed fold's OWN
     agreement set becomes the recovery's (`subUdRecover_of_seed` — this is
     where mutual, not plain, CA is load-bearing).

* **`subUdRecover` — the sub-UD decoder.** Word-resolution list decoding at
  radius δ: pick any codeword with a `(1−δ)`-fraction agreement set (`dif`
  idiom, junk `0` outside — `recoverFromColumns`'s honesty discipline).
  PROVED: always a codeword (`subUdRecover_mem`); pins UNIQUELY below
  `dC/2` (`subUdRecover_sound`); exact on genuine codewords
  (`subUdRecover_codeword`); and — the adversarial content — the increment
  of two committed folds that only δ-AGREE with the honest successive
  partial folds is recovered EXACTLY at radius `2δ`
  (`subUdRecover_increment`, via `card_inter_agreement` +
  `increment_agreesOn`: the two agreement sets intersect in a
  `(1−2δ)`-fraction set that still pins). The composed headline is
  `subUdRecover_of_foldFamily`: family closeness event ⇒ the recovery
  agrees with the committed increment on a mutual agreement set carrying a
  SIMULTANEOUS correction of the previous fold, and the recovered family
  reproduces the committed family on that set at EVERY challenge — the
  opened columns that land in it are exactly reproduced.

* **The seam, re-proved with NO `t ≥ d` anywhere.**
  `subUdSeamCounterfactual` mirrors `seamCounterfactual` field for field
  with ONE change visible in the type: it consumes the recommitted fold
  WORDS (`folds : ℕ → ι → F` — what the roots bind) where the old seam
  consumed opened COLUMNS (`cols : ℕ → Fin t → F`), and routes the
  increment `γ⁻¹ • (folds (k+1) − folds k)` (`seam_increment`) through
  `subUdRecover` instead of `recoverFromColumns`. `extractChain_subUdSeam`
  then inverts the whole chain — `extractChain_flatFold` cited, the shapes
  regime-independent exactly as `[ZK-RBR-extract]` predicted — with no
  column count, no query injectivity, no `d ≤ t` hypothesis in the entire
  composition. Consequence, computed on F₅: at `t = 1 < d = 2` (inside the
  constrained-mask hiding window `t + r ≤ d`) hiding HOLDS while the
  increment is recovered (`subud_hiding_coexist_F5`, citing the landed
  `window_F5`) — the regime `not_constrainedMask_hiding_of_recoverable`
  proved impossible for the COLUMN seam is inhabited by the WORD seam.

* **Honest scope — what "recovery" consumes here.** The sub-UD route reads
  the fold words at ROOT resolution (in the ideal binding model the root
  determines the word — `Loom/Commitment.lean`'s discipline), not at column
  resolution; rung 3 proves this is NOT a convenience but a necessity. The
  δ-closeness EVENT (`hobs`) enters as a premise: bridging it from the
  deployed `t`-column spot checks is the sampling bound, part (iv) of the
  residual — `t` enters the sub-UD seam ONLY as soundness amplification
  (a fold δ-far from its checked shape survives one uniformly-opened column
  with probability ≤ `1 − δ`; `card_compl_le_of_agreement` is the mass
  bound it composes with), never as an interpolation count. And every CA
  theorem rides the standing `hPG` hypothesis (WHIR Thm 4.8 / BCIKS
  2020/654) exactly as the landed `Loom/ReedSolomon.lean` corollaries do —
  hypothesis, never instance or axiom.

**Keystones** (F₅ at the landed `RS[F₅, {0,1,2,3}, 2]` + a fresh
`RS[F₁₁, {0..7}, 2]` corruption site + the full-rate `hPG`-inhabited site):
recovery fires at `t`-free `d = 2` (`subud_recover_xWord`); the family
theorem fires END TO END with every hypothesis discharged at the full-rate
code (`subud_family_fires` — genuine `IsProximityGenerator`, nonzero
closeness probability, `B⋆`-interval inhabited); the seam extraction fires
at depth 2 on the landed masked family `msEx` with NO column hypothesis
(`subud_seam_extraction_F5` — compare `seam_extraction_F5`'s `t = d`);
teeth: identical family column tables for `xWord` vs `twoXWord` at
`t = 1 < d` defeat EVERY column extractor while `subUdRecover` returns both
exactly (`family_pins_where_columns_cannot`, `single_fold_ambiguous_F5`);
the old decoder is junk at `t < d` and confidently WRONG on corrupted
columns where the new one CORRECTS (`old_route_junk_new_route_recovers`,
`old_route_decodes_wrong_on_corruption` vs `corrupted_increment_recovered`
— a genuinely non-codeword committed increment, `corrupted_increment_not_code`,
decoded to the true codeword); the UD-radius premise is load-bearing:
beyond `dC/2` two codewords qualify at once (`beyond_ud_list_ambiguous` —
the `[SUBUD-johnson]` frontier, computed). No `sorry`, no vacuous
`Prop := True`.

From the observable family event (the recommitted fold at a random challenge

recovered family reproduces the committed family throughout `S` — so every
opened column landing in `S` (all but a δ-fraction of any query schedule,
`card_compl_le_of_agreement`) is exactly reproduced. Correlated agreement
does the pinning (`foldFamily_correlatedAgreement`); unique decoding forces
the codeword (`subUdRecover_sound`). Where the erasure seam demanded
`d ≤ t`, NOTHING here counts columns — the premise the deployed protocol

and its mutual-CA form is BUILT and PROVED at the unique-decoding radius:
the family event pins the increment codeword
(`subUdRecover_of_foldFamily`, `subUdRecover_of_seed`), corruption within
the `2δ`-window is corrected (`subUdRecover_increment`), and the whole
chain extraction runs through the column-free seam
(`extractChain_subUdSeam`), restoring coexistence with constrained-mask
hiding at `t + r ≤ d` (`subud_hiding_coexist_F5`) — the incompatibility
that DEFINED lemma A does not exist at word resolution. What remains is
four named parts, none absorbed:

* **(i) The proximity-generator realizer** — the standing `hPG`
  hypothesis: `IsProximityGenerator (affineGenerator F) (RS[dom, d]) B err`
  with proven parameters. In the UD regime (`δ < dC/2`, all this file
  invokes) the literature bound is BCIKS 2020/654 Thm 1.2's unique-decoding
  case (`err = n/|F|` shape) — PROVABLE future work, the near-term target;
  it slots into `hPG` with zero re-derivation and makes
  `subud_family_fires`'s pattern available at macroscopic rate. The
  Johnson-regime realizer (`B = √ρ`) is WHIR Thm 4.8 / BCIKS Thm 1.2 —
  harder, inherited unchanged from `Loom/ReedSolomon.lean`'s keystone TODO.
* **(ii) Mutual CA beyond the UD radius.** The landed Lemma 4.10 upgrade
  caps the mutual-CA bound at `B⋆ = max (1 − dC/2) B` — its proof is
  intrinsically unique-decoding. For `δ ∈ (dC/2, 1 − √ρ)` mutual CA is
  WHIR Conjecture 4.12's territory: OPEN IN THE LITERATURE, and this file
  consumes nothing from it — every theorem here prices its radius inside
  `(0, min {dC/2, 1 − B})`.
* **(iii) The list pin beyond `dC/2`.** `subUdRecover_sound`'s singleton
  pin (via `codeword_eq_of_close_of_close`) becomes a LIST pin: for
  `δ ≤ 1 − √ρ − η` the qualifying-codeword count is Johnson-bounded
  (≤ `1/(2η√ρ)`), and selecting the intended element is exactly the landed
  prose seam `[OOD-pin-proximity]` (`Loom/OutOfDomain.lean`) — an
  out-of-domain evaluation pins the list member.
  `beyond_ud_list_ambiguous` is the computed witness that the selection
  problem is real at `δ > dC/2`.
* **(iv) The sampling bridge.** `hobs` — the closeness EVENT's probability
  — must be discharged from the deployed `t`-column spot checks: a fold
  δ-far from every codeword survives one uniform column with probability
  ≤ `1 − δ`, so `t` columns leave the event's complement mass
  ≤ `(1 − δ)^t` per fold; `card_compl_le_of_agreement` is the agreement-set
  side of that computation. `t` enters the sub-UD seam HERE — as soundness
  amplification only — and this is the honest boundary of
  `subUdSeamCounterfactual`'s word-resolution input: the fold words enter
  via what the roots bind (ideal binding, `Loom/Commitment.lean`), and the
  adversarial gap between "root-bound word" and "δ-close corrected word"
  is priced by (iv) + the lagged-root attribution already named in
  `[ACC-rbr-bcs-resid]`(a).

**What is NOT at risk.** Every citation is a landed unconditional theorem:
`codeword_eq_of_close_of_close`, `relDist_le_of_agreesOn`,
`reedSolomonCode_minDist`, `reedSolomonCode_hasMutualCorrelatedAgreement`
(given `hPG`), `comb_affineGenerator`, `isProximityGenerator_top`,
`reedSolomonCode_card_eq_top`, `partialFold_succ`, `flatFold_updSched`,
`extractChain_flatFold`, `extractPair_snd`,
`recoverFromColumns_junk_outside_regime`, `recoverFromColumns_sound`,
`window_F5`. The negative results here (`single_fold_word_ambiguous`,
`foldFamily_columns_ambiguous`, `no_column_extractor`,
`beyond_ud_list_ambiguous`) are proofs, not conjectures.

**Honest assessment of the seam.** CLOSED at this file's resolution: the
recovery theory at the UD radius — the diagnosis (columns can never carry
it), the mechanism (mutual CA over the challenge family), the decoder with
exactness on codewords and correction within `2δ`, the full chain
extraction, and the hiding coexistence that lemma A's conflict said was
impossible. OPEN: realizing `hPG` (provable, UD case), the sampling bridge
from `t`-column checks to the closeness event (provable, quantitative),
the root-to-word attribution in the deployed BCS game (inherited,
`[ACC-rbr-bcs-resid]`(a)), and the radius extension past `dC/2` (rides
literature-open WHIR Conj. 4.12 + `[OOD-pin-proximity]`). The first two
are the load-bearing remainder for deploying the constrained-mask seam;
neither touches the shapes landed here.

## Ledger

* `ProximityGenerator.pr_one` — PROVED: the certain event has probability 1.
* `foldFamily` (+ `_apply`, `_eq_comb`) — DEFINED/PROVED: the correlated
  fold family; IS the affine generator's combination on `![f₀, g]`.
* `single_fold_word_ambiguous` / `extractPair_foldFamily` /
  `foldFamily_columns_ambiguous` / `no_column_extractor` — PROVED: the
  recovery ladder's rungs 1–3 — one fold word pins nothing, two exact
  words pin completely (landed `extractPair` cited), `t < d` columns of
  the WHOLE family pin nothing against ANY extractor.
* `subUdRecover` (+ `_mem`, `_sound`, `_codeword`) — DEFINED/PROVED: the
  word-resolution sub-UD decoder; always a codeword; pins UNIQUELY below
  `dC/2` (landed unique decoding cited); exact on codewords.
* `foldFamily_correlatedAgreement` / `foldFamily_mutualCA` /
  `subUdRecover_of_seed` — PROVED: the mutual-CA step on the seam's own
  object — common agreement set for (previous fold, increment); the landed
  WHIR 4.10/4.11 cited verbatim; per non-failing seed the observed
  agreement set is the recovery's.
* `subUdRecover_of_foldFamily` — PROVED: the composed sub-UD recovery —
  family event ⇒ increment pinned on a mutual agreement set carrying the
  previous fold's simultaneous correction and reproducing the committed
  family at every challenge.
* `card_compl_le_of_agreement` / `card_inter_agreement` /
  `increment_agreesOn` / `subUdRecover_increment` — PROVED: the
  off-agreement mass bound; two `(1−δ)`-sets meet in a `(1−2δ)`-set; the
  corrupted-fold increment agrees there; recovery EXACT at radius `2δ`.
* `partialFold_foldFamily` / `seam_increment` / `subUdSeamCounterfactual`
  (+ `_sound`) / `extractChain_subUdSeam` — DEFINED/PROVED: the seam at
  word resolution — `seamCounterfactual` with fold words for columns and
  `subUdRecover` for `recoverFromColumns`; chain extraction end to end
  with NO `d ≤ t` anywhere.
* Keystones — `subud_recover_xWord`, `subud_recover_twoXWord`,
  `old_route_junk_new_route_recovers`, `subud_hiding_coexist_F5`,
  `cols_eq`, `family_pins_where_columns_cannot`,
  `single_fold_ambiguous_F5`, `beyond_ud_list_ambiguous`, `rs_top`,
  `subud_family_fires`, `subud_family_recover_exact`,
  `subud_seam_extraction_F5`, `corrupted_increment_recovered`,
  `corrupted_increment_ne`, `corrupted_increment_not_code`,
  `old_route_decodes_wrong_on_corruption` — fired/computed on
  `RS[F₅,·,2]`, `RS[F₅,·,4]` (genuine `hPG`), and `RS[F₁₁,·,2]`
  (genuine corruption corrected).
* Residual — `[SUBUD-johnson]` (prose above): (i) the `hPG` realizer
  (UD case provable), (ii) mutual CA past `dC/2` (WHIR Conj. 4.12,
  literature-open), (iii) the Johnson list pin + `[OOD-pin-proximity]`
  selection, (iv) the `t`-column sampling bridge + root attribution
  (`[ACC-rbr-bcs-resid]`(a) inherited).
