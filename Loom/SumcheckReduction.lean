# Loom.SumcheckReduction — the sumcheck front retires the constraint channel.

LOOM §6: the accumulated object is a multi-constrained CRS claim; the decider's
SINGLE sumcheck absorbs the whole constraint list. This file is the bridge that
makes that sentence a theorem: a `ConstrainedCode` linear constraint
`⟨wt, f⟩ = σ` (`Satisfies`/`dotWt`) IS a sumcheck sum-claim
`Σ_i wt(i)·f(i) = σ` over the evaluation domain — the exact object
`Loom/Sumcheck.lean`'s proved soundness reduces — so a word VIOLATING the
constraint survives the sumcheck's random challenges only with the
round-by-round probability `v·d/|F|`.

**What is proved here (no `sorry`, no new soundness derivation — pure wiring of
the two landed layers):**

* `constraint_as_sumcheck` — **the bridge, definitional**: `Satisfies f c` ↔ the
  sum-claim `Σ_i constraintSummand c f i = c.target` holds (`Iff.rfl`; the
  summand is `i ↦ c.wt i · f i`, the claimed total is the constraint target, the
  TRUE total `trueSum c f` is the actual pairing `dotWt`).
* `constraint_as_hypercube_sum` — the claim-OBJECT half of the reshaping: along
  any index equivalence `ι ≃ ({0,1}^v)` the constraint's sum becomes literally a
  sum over the boolean hypercube, the domain sumcheck walks.
* `sumcheck_retires_constraint` — **the retirement theorem (fixed round
  polynomials)**: run the sumcheck front on the constraint's sum-claim (claimed
  total `c.target`, honest truth chain anchored at `trueSum c f`); if the word
  violates the constraint, the verifier accepts with probability `≤ v·d/|F|`.
  Direct reuse of `sumcheck_soundness` — the violation `¬ Satisfies f c` IS the
  `H ≠ S` clause of `AcceptsFalse`.
* `satisfies_not_acceptsFalse` — the honest side: a word SATISFYING the
  constraint has no lie to launder (`AcceptsFalse` is impossible outright).
* `adaptive_sumcheck_soundness` / `adaptive_sumcheck_retires_constraint` — the
  **adaptive packaging** Sumcheck.lean names as its one unbuilt piece, assembled
  here (no soundness re-derived): round polynomials may depend on the challenge
  PREFIX (`PrefixMeasurable`); the per-transcript reduction
  (`sumcheck_reduction`) lands each accepted-false transcript in a
  prefix-measurable laundering set (`launderSet`, `≤ d` elements by the reused
  root count `card_agreeFinset_lt`), and the DISCHARGED
  `adaptiveUnionBound_holds` gives `≤ v·d/|F|`. This matters because the fixed
  theorem's honest hypothesis forces near-constant truth chains at `v ≥ 2`; the
  adaptive form is the one a real multi-round honest prover (the MLE round
  polynomials) inhabits.
* **§6 absorption of the list**: `list_as_single_sumcheck` — a word satisfying a
  WHOLE constraint list satisfies the single γ-batched sum-claim (reuse of
  `satisfies_batch_of_forall`); `batch_survives_prob_le` — stage 1 of the
  soundness pipeline in probability form: a list-violating word's γ-batch stays
  TRUE for `≤ (t−1)/|F|` of uniform γ (reuse of `card_batch_satisfying_le`
  through `uniformProb_mem_finset`); `sumcheck_retires_batch` — stage 2: for
  every γ where the batch stays violated, ONE sumcheck on the batched claim
  catches the word except with probability `v·d/|F|`. Round-by-round reading:
  the γ-round contributes `(t−1)/|F|` and the sumcheck rounds `v·d/|F|` to the
  additive RBR error ledger — the whole linear (ℤ-linear, γ-linear) part of the
  accumulated constraint list is retired by one sumcheck.

**Keystones (ATLAS: satisfiable + teeth, BUILT, over F₅ — reusing
`CRSExample`'s constraint `f(1) = 1` and words):** `SCRExample.xWord_sumClaim` —
the honest codeword's constraint rendered AS the sum-claim, computed;
`xWord_hypercube_sumClaim` — the same claim transported to `{0,1}²` along an
explicit `Fin 4 ≃ (Fin 2 → Bool)`, computed; `xWord_never_caught` — the honest
word is never falsely convicted. Teeth: the zero word violates the constraint
(claimed `1`, true total `0` — `zero_trueSum`); `zero_word_caught` instantiates
the retirement theorem CONCRETELY (one round, cheating prover `g̃ = X` passing
the round check), every hypothesis discharged, bound `1/5`; and
`zero_word_accept_witness` exhibits the challenge `r = 0` on which the cheat IS
accepted — the caught-event is nonempty, so the bound constrains a real event,
not a vacuum. `adaptive_bound_fires` runs the adaptive packaging on the same
data.

**Residual — `[SC-reshape]` (prose, per the `[CRS-batch-sound]` precedent: no
placeholder Prop).** What remains between this file and a turnkey decider
sumcheck is the HONEST-PROVER REALIZER: exhibiting the multilinear-extension
round polynomials — WHIR Def 4.5's `f̂` (and the weight's `â`), with
`gᵢ(X) = Σ_{b ∈ {0,1}^{v−i−1}} â·f̂(r₁,…,rᵢ₋₁, X, b)` — as the `honest` family,
discharging `hHonest` (boolean-sum consistency, degree `≤ deg(â·f̂)` per round)
and realizing the final oracle check as the evaluation `â(r)·f̂(r)`. The claim
OBJECT is already reshaped (`constraint_as_hypercube_sum`); the adaptive
protocol shape the MLE prover needs is packaged (`adaptive_sumcheck_soundness`);
only the MLE construction itself is future vocabulary. Everything above is
stated so that realizer plugs in as a hypothesis instantiation, not a
restatement.

/-! ## The adaptive packaging (prefix-dependent round polynomials)

`sumcheck_soundness` fixes the round polynomials up front; its honest
boolean-sum hypothesis then forces near-constant truth chains for `v ≥ 2`, so
the fixed theorem is really the one-round engine iterated. A real multi-round
prover — honest (the MLE round polynomials) or cheating — chooses round `i`'s
polynomial from the challenge prefix. Sumcheck.lean proved both halves of the
adaptive statement (`sumcheck_reduction` per transcript,
`adaptiveUnionBound_holds` for prefix-measurable bad sets) and named the
packaging as its one unbuilt piece; this section builds exactly that packaging,
re-deriving no soundness content. -/

`LinearConstraint`, hence — through the bridge — to ONE sum-claim. Stage 1 (the
γ round): a list-violating word's batch stays true for at most `(t−1)/|F|` of
uniform γ. Stage 2 (the sumcheck rounds): wherever the batch stays violated,
one sumcheck catches the word except with probability `v·d/|F|`. The two stages
are exactly the additive contributions to the RBR error ledger of §6. -/

`CRSExample`'s constraint `f(1) = 1` on the 4-point domain, its honest codeword
`xWord = (0,1,2,3)` and the violating zero word — now driven through the
sumcheck front. Everything computes on the actual data. -/
