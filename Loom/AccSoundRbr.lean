# Loom.AccSoundRbr — [ACC-sound-rbr]: the γ-fold's bound as an RBR round error.

Closes the PACKAGING half of `Loom/AccSound.lean`'s `[ACC-sound-rbr]` residual:
the accumulator's cross-word fold (WHIR Constr. 7.4, `Loom/Accumulator.lean`'s
`foldClaims`) IS one round of an RBR game (`Loom/Rbr.lean`'s WARP Def 4.2
vocabulary) — its challenge is a uniform field element, its per-round error is
`AccSound`'s proved bound. Supplying that error function in the exact shape
`RbrKnowledgeSoundness.err` expects is what lets `Loom/FiatShamir.lean`'s
`FsOfRbrSound` (PROVED, unconditional) price the accumulator's Fiat–Shamir
compilation with the `(t + k)·ε_rbr` grinding factor — the connective tissue
`[LC-fs-adaptive]` (`Loom/LightClientFS.lean`) names and rides.

## What is PROVED here (no sorry, no axioms)

* `accRbrError` — the round-error function: `err⋆(δ) + 1/|F|`, literally
  `foldClaims_sound_proximity_UD`'s RHS (WHIR Constr. 7.4 at `s = 2`, `ℓ = 1`,
  unique decoding), read as a bound on `Loom/Rbr.lean`'s own `uniformProb`
  (imported, not re-derived — the SAME probability function `RbrKnowledgeSoundness
  .extract_sound` measures its per-round event with). At `errstar ≡ 0`
  (available whenever mutual CA is exact, e.g. `C = ⊤`,
  `hasMutualCorrelatedAgreement_top_affine`) it specializes to the exact-word
  bound `1/|F| = (s−1)/|F|`.
* `accSound_rbr` — **the round-error bound, PROVED**: the fold's δ-proximity
  event, measured by `uniformProb F` (`F` playing the role of an RBR round's
  challenge type `r.Chal`), is `≤ accRbrError`. This is `foldClaims_sound_proximity_UD`
  verbatim, renamed into Rbr's vocabulary — REUSE, no re-derivation.
* `accSound_rbr_exact` — the exact-word specialization (`errstar ≡ 0`), from
  `foldClaims_sound_exact` verbatim.
* `accRbrError_nonneg` — `accRbrError` is a legitimate `εrbr` candidate:
  nonnegative whenever `errstar` is (the first hypothesis `FsOfRbrSound` and
  `OB2_depth_composition` both demand of any uniform round-error bound).
* `accFsSound` — **[LC-fs-adaptive] discharged for the accumulator, MODULO the
  game instance**: given ANY `Reduction`/`RbrKnowledgeSoundness` pair whose
  per-round error is bounded by `accRbrError` on a statement set `Z` (exactly
  what `[ACC-sound-rbr-game]` below must supply), Fiat–Shamir of it is
  straightline knowledge-sound with the `(t + k)·accRbrError` grinding factor.
  Cites `fsKeystone_proved.sound` (`FsOfRbrSound`, `Loom/FiatShamir.lean`,
  PROVED, unconditional) — does NOT re-derive the FS/BCS argument.

## What REMAINS: `[ACC-sound-rbr-game]` (honest residual, prose)

`accSound_rbr` supplies the NUMBER and the MEASURE (`uniformProb` over the
fold's own challenge field `F`) that a round of an RBR game must bound. It
does **not** assemble a concrete `Reduction`/`KStateFn`/`extract`/
`RbrKnowledgeSoundness r` quadruple for the accumulator — i.e. `accFsSound`'s
`rbr` and its `hbound` hypothesis are still supplied by the caller, not built
here. That assembly is `[ACC-sound-rbr-game]`, and it is genuinely heavy, not
bureaucratically heavy — an audit finding worth recording plainly:

* **The naive single-round embedding does not close.** The obvious attempt —
  one round, `Chal := F`, prover message trivial (`PMsg := Unit`, no
  interactive content before the challenge, matching the fold's actual
  shape), knowledge-state witness `W := (ι → F) × (ι → F)` (the claimed
  decomposition `(u, v)` of the folded word), `extract := id` — does **not**
  discharge `RbrKnowledgeSoundness.extract_sound` from `foldClaims_sound_proximity_UD`
  as stated. The obstruction is real, not a formalization nuisance: WARP
  Def 4.2's per-round bound is **unconditional** over every `(u, v)`
  satisfying the target relation at the extended transcript, whereas
  `foldClaims_sound_proximity_UD`'s hypothesis `hfar` is a **falseness**
  assumption (no NEARBY pair jointly satisfies the individual claims). Given
  an arbitrary claimed `(u, v) ∈ C × C` with `u + γ • v` merely `δ`-close to
  the fold `f + γ • g`, there is in general NO bound on how far `(u, v)` sits
  from the true `(f, g)`: since `C` is a linear code, `(u, v) ↦ u + γ • v` has
  a large kernel (`(c, 0)` and `(0, c/γ)` both sum to `c` for any codeword
  `c`), so closeness of the SUM to the fold says nothing about closeness of
  the SUMMANDS without the mutual-correlated-agreement argument's
  agreement-SET structure — which reads off `(u, v)` from the *specific*
  nearby codeword's disagreement pattern with `f + γ • g` (`AccSound`'s
  `hgood`/`hfu`/`hgv`), not from an externally supplied candidate pair. A
  faithful `extract` has to run that argument internally (Classical-choice
  the decomposition from the mutual-CA non-failure witness, δ-obliviously —
  Def 4.2 gives `extract` no `δ` input, so it must fix a canonical radius,
  naturally the unique-decoding one `dC/2` baked into the `Reduction`'s
  index data rather than threaded per-call).
* **The natural realizer is two-point, not one-point.** `Loom/AccExtract.lean`'s
  `extractPair` — the straightline extractor this residual names as the
  intended realizer — recovers `(f, g)` from TWO fold evaluations at distinct
  challenges, not one. WARP's backward round extractor (Def 4.2) is seeded
  from a SINGLE extended transcript per round; reconciling that shape with a
  genuinely two-point recovery is exactly the `[ACC-extract]`/`[ACC-extract-chain]`
  machinery's job (`accKnowledgeSound`, `extractChain`'s per-link peeling),
  not a fix internal to a single round's `KStateFn`. The chain-level
  `Reduction` (`k` = the light-client's `n` links, one challenge per fold,
  matching `Loom/LightClientFS.lean`'s schedule) is the right level for
  `[ACC-sound-rbr-game]`'s assembly, not a single fold in isolation — WARP
  Thm B.4's SR game already unions over *all* rounds' output-prefix queries,
  which is where the second evaluation a straightline extractor needs
  naturally arises.
* **What is NOT at risk**: the NUMBER (`accRbrError`) and its proof
  (`accSound_rbr`) are real theorems, unconditionally correct as bounds on
  `uniformProb F` events — nothing above casts doubt on the bound itself,
  only on the bureaucratic-looking-but-substantive work of exhibiting a
  `KStateFn`/`extract` pair whose OWN `extract_sound` event refines into
  (implies) the fold event `accSound_rbr` bounds. Realizer named:
  `Loom/AccExtract.lean`'s `extractPair` + `Loom/AccExtractChain.lean`'s
  `extractChain`, assembled at the chain level.
