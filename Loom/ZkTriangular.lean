# Loom.ZkTriangular — [ZK-RBR-interleave] missing lemma 1 attacked: TRIANGULAR
joint hiding of the recommitted partial folds. The backward induction through
the ∀-witness quantifier CLOSES — both fields.

`Loom/RbrZeroKnowledge.lean` proved the multi-round chain simulator for the
FRESH-MASK PRODUCT model (round `k` opens `mask (fs k) (γs k) (gs k)` — its
own pre-mask word, its own fresh draw) and named the deployed gap as
`[ZK-RBR-interleave]`'s first missing lemma: in the recommitment schedule,
round `k` opens the `k`-th PARTIAL FOLD, which contains every EARLIER round's
mask — the joint opening map is TRIANGULAR (round `k` reads `gs 0 … gs k`),
the joint fibers no longer factor into per-round fibers, and the
COORDINATEWISE translation of `chain_fiber_equinum` stops preserving them.
This file builds that triangular model and PROVES its joint hiding. The
residual's own prediction — "a backward induction over rounds (condition on
`gs 0 … gs (k−1)`, apply round `k`'s hiding at the resulting pre-mask word)
should recover joint uniformity" — is carried out and CLOSES, at the model
level, with no `sorry` and no vacuous `Prop := True`.

**The model.** `triPre γs fs gs k` is the pre-mask word at round `k` (the
first `k+1` rounds' words plus the EARLIER rounds' mask contributions);
`triFold γs fs gs k = mask (triPre …) (γs k) (gs k)` is the `k`-th
recommitted partial fold — round `k`'s own fresh draw enters BY the landed
fold word operation `mask`, at round `k`'s challenge, on top of a word that
already contains `gs 0 … gs (k−1)`. The recursion is exhibited, not just
asserted: `triPre_bot` (round 0's pre-mask word is its own word, mask-free)
and `triFold_succ` (each recommitted word is `mask` of (previous recommitted
word + new round word) at the round challenge with the round's fresh draw —
the `foldWords` step shape with the mask folded in). Two modeling choices,
stated honestly rather than hidden: (1) the REAL words' fold weights are
absorbed into `fs` — legal as a WLOG because every hiding field quantifies
over ALL word families `fs`, so `fs k := γᵏ-weighted real word` is an
instance, and the mask challenges `γs k` (which hiding dials on) are NOT
absorbed; (2) each recommitted word is opened at its OWN round only —
WARP's recommitment-schedule invariant, here true BY CONSTRUCTION of
`triOpen`, not derived from a protocol object. (2) is the honest boundary of
this file and heads the sharpened residual below.

**What closes, and how.**

* **`TriangularHiding`** — the deployed analog of `RbrZeroKnowledge`'s two
  chain fields, on the SAME `jointMasks` space: `tri_sim_support` (the joint
  opened tuples of all `n` triangular rounds reach ALL of
  `Fin n → Fin t → F`, for EVERY word family) and `tri_fiber_equinum` (any
  two triangular explaining fibers are carried onto each other by ONE
  translation from the joint mask space). Witness-freedom is again
  syntactic: `fs` universally quantified, absent from every right-hand side.
* **`triOpen_prefix_reach`** — THE induction. Round `m`'s draw is chosen by
  applying `MaskedOpeningHiding.sim_support_univ` AT the mask-dependent
  pre-mask word `triPre γs fs gs ⟨m,_⟩` — the word that contains the
  already-chosen `gs 0 … gs (m−1)`. This is exactly the application the
  ∀-WITNESS quantifier position of the landed field makes legal ("for EVERY
  witness `f`" — including one built from earlier mask draws); a
  fixed-witness hiding statement would not compose here. Earlier rounds are
  undisturbed because `triFold` at round `k` reads only `gs j`, `j ≤ k`
  (`triFold_congr`).
* **`triangularHiding_of_rounds`** — per-round hiding implies triangular
  joint hiding. Support is the induction at full depth. Fibers: the joint
  opening is AFFINE in the mask family — `triOpen q γs fs gs =
  triOpen q γs fs 0 + triOpen q γs 0 gs` (`triOpen_decomp`), a public
  word-part plus a lower-triangular LINEAR part `L := triOpen q γs 0` — so
  the translation between the fibers over `(fs₁,vs₁)` and `(fs₂,vs₂)` is ANY
  `cs ∈ jointMasks M` with `L cs` = the fiber-difference target, and such
  `cs` exists by the SUPPORT theorem applied at the ZERO word family. The
  triangular schedule broke the product FACTORING of the proof, not the
  THEOREM: joint fibers are cosets of one kernel, and the translation is
  BACK-SUBSTITUTED through the triangle instead of assembled coordinatewise.

**Honest consumption profile.** Only `sim_support_univ` is consumed — the
per-round `fiber_equinum` field is never used (the joint translation comes
from joint surjectivity, not from transporting per-round translations). And
NO transparency iff is claimed, in deliberate contrast to
`rbrZeroKnowledge_iff_rounds`: `TriangularHiding → ∀ k, MaskedOpeningHiding`
is not proved here (at a later round the per-round "witness" would have to
be reconstructed from a mask-dependent partial fold), so the composition is
stated one-directional, which is the direction deployment needs.

**Teeth — the γ-dial has TWO failure modes at depth, one of them new.**
Round 0 with a zero challenge publishes its word's opened symbols bare
(`not_triangularHiding_of_zero_first` — the product model's failure mode).
But a LATER round with a zero challenge fails differently: its opening
repeats the previous recommitted word — the earlier rounds' masks CANCEL in
the difference of successive openings, and the difference publishes the
round WORD's opened symbols (`triOpen_succ_zero_leak`, refutation
`not_triangularHiding_of_zero_succ`). Earlier masks do NOT save a maskless
later round; this leak-through-the-difference mode does not exist in the
product model, where round `k`'s opening never sees round `j < k` at all.

**Keystones** (F₅, the SAME instance as `RbrZkExample`: both rounds' masks
from `constrainedMaskSpace dom₅ 2 pt2`, opened at `qz`, base schedule
`(1,1)`): satisfiable — `triangularHiding_F5` fires by composition, and
`tri_reach_F5` COMPUTES the induction's choice at depth 2 (round 1's draw
`lineOf 4 2` picked at the mask-dependent partial fold, reaching the
all-zero tuple, membership included); teeth — `tri_dependence` computes that
round 1's opened symbols MOVE when only round 0's mask changes (own masks
equal) while `product_model_blind` computes that `jointOpen` cannot see the
difference — the fresh-mask product theorem `rbrZeroKnowledge_of_rounds`
does NOT apply to this opening map, and the triangular structure is real;
both zero-challenge refutation modes instantiated
(`not_tri_zero_round0_F5`, `not_tri_zero_round1_F5`, leaked value computed
`leak_value`). Residual `[ZK-RBR-triangular]` at the bottom: what remains is
the DEPLOYMENT BRIDGE (identify `triFold` with the mask-augmented
`foldWords`/`aggregate` chain word and DERIVE the opened-once schedule
invariant from the protocol object), plus `[ZK-RBR-interleave]`'s
extraction flank, untouched here and inherited unchanged.

/-! ## The triangular fold word

Round `k`'s recommitted word, as deployed: everything folded so far — the
first `k+1` rounds' words, the earlier rounds' masks at their challenges —
re-masked by round `k`'s own fresh draw at round `k`'s challenge. Defined in
closed form (sums over `j ≤ k` / `j < k`) so that the joint objects below
quantify over the SAME `Fin n`-indexed families as the landed product model;
the recursive fold structure is then a THEOREM (`triPre_bot`,
`triFold_succ`), not a definition swap. -/

filter); every earlier mask DOES. This is the mask-dependent "witness" the

  support is the full public product space, witness-free.

  the joint distribution is uniform on that support, identically in the
  word family. Perfect, distribution-equality hiding of the whole deployed
  leakage surface.

/-! ## Residual obligation — prose, not a stub

**`[ZK-RBR-triangular]`** — the sharpened remainder of
`[ZK-RBR-interleave]`'s missing lemma 1, after this file. The lemma's
MATHEMATICS is now closed: for the abstract triangular schedule — round `k`
opens the `k`-th recommitted partial fold, once — per-round
`MaskedOpeningHiding` composes into joint hiding of the whole deployed
leakage surface (`triangularHiding_of_rounds`), by the backward induction
the residual predicted, through exactly the ∀-witness quantifier it named.
What remains is the BRIDGE from this model to the deployed chain object,
and it is one named lemma plus one named invariant:

* **The deployment bridge.** Define the mask-AUGMENTED chain — each round's
  mask claim folded as its own link into `Loom/LightClient.lean`'s
  `foldWords`/`aggregate` recursion (the fold step `f + γs 0 • w`,
  `foldWords_cons`) — and prove that its per-round recommitted word IS
  `triFold γs fs gs k`, where `fs k` absorbs the real links' fold weights.
  The absorption is a WLOG at the hiding statement (every field here
  quantifies over ALL `fs`), but the bridge equation itself is a real lemma
  about `foldWords`, not a quantifier remark; `triFold_succ` is its
  step-shape on this side. With the bridge, `TriangularHiding` transports
  verbatim to the deployed object.
* **The schedule invariant, derived not assumed.** `triOpen` opens round
  `k`'s recommitted word at round `k` ONLY — `Loom/ZKHiding.lean`'s
  multi-step residual named this ("each committed word is opened at ONE
  step only", WARP's recommitment schedule) and this file CONSUMES it by
  construction. The bridge must derive it from the protocol's opening
  schedule: if some committed word were opened at two rounds, the joint
  opening map would repeat a row and `tri_sim_support` would be FALSE for
  it (the two coordinates would be correlated — the `γ = 0` teeth
  `not_triangularHiding_of_zero_succ` is exactly the degenerate case where
  round `k+1`'s opening IS a repeat of round `k`'s word). The invariant is
  load-bearing, not decorative.
* **What is NOT here and was not claimed.** The converse transparency
  (`TriangularHiding → ∀ k, MaskedOpeningHiding`) is unproved — the
  composition is one-directional. And `[ZK-RBR-interleave]`'s missing
  lemma 2 — masked-chain EXTRACTION through the `[ACC-extract-bind]`
  opened-column seam, the extractor and simulator consuming the same `t·n`
  symbols — is untouched by this file and inherited unchanged, along with
  the game packaging owed to `[ACC-sound-rbr-game]`.

## Ledger

* `triPre` / `triFold` (+ `triFold_def`, `triPre_bot`, `triPre_succ`,
  `triFold_succ`, `triPre_congr`, `triFold_congr`, `triFold_decomp`,
  `triFold_zero_add`) — DEFINED/PROVED: the recommitted partial fold as a
  recursive fold word (recursion exhibited as theorems), reading only
  coordinates `≤ k`, affine in the mask family.
* `triOpen` / `triMaskFiber` (+ `triOpen_decomp`, `triOpen_zero_add`,
  `mem_triMaskFiber`) — DEFINED: the deployed triangular leakage surface
  and its explaining fibers; the opening map's affine decomposition.
* `TriangularHiding` — DEFINED: the deployed analog of the chain simulator
  fields, witness-free by quantifier position; NO transparency iff claimed.
* `triOpen_prefix_reach` — PROVED: the backward induction; round `m`'s draw
  chosen by `sim_support_univ` AT the mask-dependent partial fold.
* `triangularHiding_of_rounds` — PROVED: per-round hiding ⇒ triangular
  joint hiding, BOTH fields; fibers via the back-substituted translation
  from the support theorem at the zero family. Only `sim_support_univ`
  consumed.
* `TriangularHiding.tri_witness_free` / `.triMaskFiber_ncard_eq` — PROVED:
  whole-schedule witness independence + the one-constant joint
  distribution, at the deployed opening map.
* `not_triangularHiding_of_zero_first` / `triOpen_succ_zero_leak` /
  `not_triangularHiding_of_zero_succ` — PROVED: both γ-dial failure modes,
  including the triangular-only difference leak (earlier masks cancel).
* Keystones — `triangularHiding_F5` + `tri_support_fired` (fired);
  `tri_reach_F5` + `reach_mem` (the induction's choice computed at the
  mask-dependent partial fold); `triPre_computed` /
  `triPre_moves_with_mask` / `tri_dependence` vs `product_model_blind`
  (round 1's opened word and symbols genuinely depend on round 0's mask;
  the product model cannot see it); `not_tri_zero_round0_F5` /
  `not_tri_zero_round1_F5` / `leak_computed` / `leak_value` (both failure
  modes live on F₅, the leaked witness symbol computed).
* Residual — `[ZK-RBR-triangular]` (prose above): the deployment bridge +
  the derived schedule invariant; interleave's extraction flank inherited
  unchanged.
