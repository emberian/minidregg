# Loom.CorrelatedAgreement — OB-6, the v0 floor realizer.

**Mutual correlated agreement at the unique-decoding radius is unconditional for
every linear code** — WHIR (eprint 2024/1586) §4.2: Definition 4.7 (proximity
generator), Definition 4.9 (mutual correlated agreement), Lemma 4.10 (in the
unique-decoding regime every proximity generator has mutual correlated agreement
with the *same* error). This is THE load-bearing property of Loom's link layer
(docs/LOOM-RECOMPOSITION.md §1: plain proximity gaps do not relate input
agreement sets to the output's — WARP fn. 6) and the v0 parameter rung (§5: the
UD regime is unconditional end-to-end).

**Transcription notes (read before auditing):**

* **`max`, not `min`.** WHIR Lemma 4.10 as printed says
  `B⋆(C,ℓ) = min{1 − δ_C/2, B(C,ℓ)}`. That is a typo for **max**: (a) the
  admissible-radius interval is `δ ∈ (0, 1 − B⋆)`, and the proof uses BOTH
  `δ < δ_C/2` (uniqueness of the nearby codeword) and `δ < 1 − B` (each
  invocation of Def 4.7), forcing `1 − B⋆ = min{δ_C/2, 1 − B}`, i.e.
  `B⋆ = max{1 − δ_C/2, B}`; (b) Corollary 4.11 instantiates RS with
  `B = √ρ`, `δ_C = 1 − ρ` and reports `B⋆ = (1+ρ)/2 = max{(1+ρ)/2, √ρ}`
  (AM–GM), whereas the printed min would give `√ρ`. We formalize the max.

* **Error monotonicity + nonnegativity are made explicit.** The paper's proof
  re-invokes Def 4.7 at a *smaller* radius than δ with the same threshold
  ("which we can do since 1 − |T|/n ≤ δ"), silently using that `err` does not
  increase when the radius shrinks; and a mutual-CA error below 0 is
  unsatisfiable (probabilities are ≥ 0). Both facts hold for every
  instantiation in the paper (Theorem 4.8's `err` is nondecreasing in δ and
  nonnegative); here they are honest hypotheses `herr_mono` / `herr_nonneg`.

* **Probability model.** A proximity generator is a finitely-supported
  distribution: a finite seed type with real weights (nonnegative, summing
  to 1), the event probability being the weight of the preimage. This covers
  every generator the papers use (uniform α ← F with powers `(1, α, …)`,
  uniform r ← F for PG(2)). Nothing in Lemma 4.10 is probabilistic beyond
  monotonicity of the measure under event inclusion, so the full statement is
  PROVED here — no deterministic-core/probabilistic-wrapper split was needed.

* **`∆(f, C) ≤ δ` as `∃ u ∈ C, ∆(f,u) ≤ δ`** (`close`): equivalent to the
  paper's min-based reading for every nonempty code (relative distance takes
  finitely many values, so the min over the — possibly infinite — code is
  attained); a submodule always contains 0, hence is nonempty.

* **Nontriviality.** `[Nonempty ι]` excludes the empty evaluation domain
  (relative distance would be 0/0). The theorem is honestly quantified: its
  δ-interval `(0, 1 − B⋆)` is nonempty iff `dC > 0` and `B < 1`; the keystone
  section at the bottom exhibits premise inhabitation (`minDistLB_inhabited`),
  a satisfiability witness where the Def 4.7 hypothesis *fires* non-vacuously
  (`isProximityGenerator_top`), and an end-to-end instantiation with a
  nonempty δ-interval (`hasMutualCorrelatedAgreement_top_affine` + the
  interval-nonemptiness `example`).

/-! ## The theorem: WHIR Lemma 4.10 -/

/-- **WHIR Lemma 4.10 — correlated agreement gives mutual correlated agreement
for free in the unique-decoding regime, for EVERY linear code.** If `Gen` is a
proximity generator for `C` with proximity bound `B` and error `err`, and `dC`
lower-bounds the pairwise relative distance of distinct codewords, then `Gen`
has mutual correlated agreement with proximity bound
`B⋆ = max (1 − dC/2) B` — i.e. on the radius interval
`δ ∈ (0, min {dC/2, 1−B})`, the unique-decoding regime — and the SAME error
`err⋆ = err`. (The paper prints `min` for `B⋆`; that is a typo for `max` — see
the module header.)

Hypotheses beyond the paper's statement, both implicit in its proof:
`herr_mono` (the error does not increase when the radius shrinks; Def 4.7 is
re-invoked at a smaller radius with the same threshold) and `herr_nonneg`
(negative error would make the conclusion unsatisfiable against `pr ≥ 0`).
Both hold for every instantiation in the paper (Theorem 4.8).

Proof (= the paper's, with the radius for the final invocation made exact):
take `T` a maximum-cardinality set on which every `fᵢ` agrees with some
codeword `uᵢ`. If the failure probability exceeds `err δ`, then (Def 4.7 at δ)
`|T| ≥ (1−δ)n`. For any failing seed with witness set `S`: the combination
`g_r = ∑ rⱼ·fⱼ` agrees with the codeword `w_r = ∑ rⱼ·uⱼ` on `T`, and with
some codeword `w'` on `S`; both are within δ of `g_r`, and `δ < dC/2` forces
`w' = w_r` (unique decoding). `S ⊄ T` (else the failing `fᵢ` would agree with
`uᵢ` on `S`), so `g_r` agrees with `w_r` on `S ∪ T ⊇ T ∪ {y}`, giving
`∆(g_r, C) ≤ (n − |T| − 1)/n < (n − |T| − ½)/n =: δ'`. Invoking Def 4.7 at δ'
(positive, ≤ δ, so `err δ' ≤ err δ <` the failure probability) yields a common
agreement set `W` with `|W| ≥ (1−δ')n = |T| + ½ > |T|` — contradicting
maximality. If instead `|T| = n`, every `fᵢ` agrees with `uᵢ` everywhere and
the failure event is empty, contradicting `err δ ≥ 0`. -/

/-! ## PG(2): the two-function affine generator (the WARP/WHIR usage)

For batching two oracles the papers draw a single `r ← F` and take the
combination `f + r·g`, i.e. coefficients `(1, r)`. We formalize THAT variant —
it is literally WHIR's `Gen(ℓ; α) = (1, α, …, α^{ℓ−1})` at `ℓ = 2` (Theorem
4.8 / Corollary 4.11 are stated for this geometric generator) and WARP's
fold/batch step. The alternative affine parametrization `(1−r, r)` (the line
`f + r·(g−f)`) generates the same set of combinations up to affine
reparametrization but is NOT the tuple Theorem 4.8 bounds, so we do not use
it. Uniform seed `r ← F` requires `F` finite (as deployed). -/
