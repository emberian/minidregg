# Loom.AccRbrBcs — [ACC-rbr-bcs]: the native RBR instance at the DEPLOYED
BCS/root alphabet — `AccRbrInstance`'s construction re-run with
`PMsg = recommitted root + opened columns + opening proofs`.

`Loom/AccRbrInstance.lean` closed `[ZK-RBR-game-resid]` at the IOR resolution
and named `[ACC-rbr-bcs]` precisely: the `Reduction` whose prover messages are
the DEPLOYED message alphabet (a recommitted root, its `t` opened columns, the
opening proofs), whose knowledge state demands COMMITTED-COLUMN CONSISTENCY
(so binding pins the words — `binding_columns`), and whose extractor
synthesizes the round word from one execution's columns (`recoverFromColumns`
through binding — the inner step of `seamCounterfactual`, composed end to end
in `extractChain_committed_seam`). This file builds that instance. The algebra
is landed (`Loom/ZkExtraction.lean`, `Loom/Commitment.lean`, `Loom/Erasure.lean`)
and is CITED, never re-derived; what is new here is only the Def-4.1/4.2
packaging at the root alphabet.

* `BcsMsg` / `ColsOpen` / `ColsConsistent` / `bcsWord` / `bcsRounds` — the
  deployed alphabet: a round message is `(root, cols, ops)`; its word is
  SYNTHESIZED by erasure decoding the opened columns
  (`recoverFromColumns`, CITED); a transcript over messages reads as a
  transcript over words (`bcsRounds`). `bcsWord_committed`: binding pins the
  synthesis — a message whose openings verify against a root committing a
  codeword synthesizes THAT codeword (`binding_columns` +
  `recoverFromColumns_sound`, both CITED).
* `accReductionBcs` — the accumulator chain as a WARP `Reduction` at the BCS
  alphabet: `k = ch.length` rounds, `Chal = F`, `PMsg = BcsMsg`; the verifier
  CHECKS EVERY OPENING (`verifyOpen` — this verifier genuinely rejects, unlike
  the IOR instance's) and on success outputs the aggregate and the fold of the
  synthesized words. Source/target relations unchanged from `accReduction`
  (genesis + aligned-channel links; word-level aggregate).
* `accKStateBcs` — Def 4.1 at the root alphabet, three clauses PROVED: the
  state is COMMITTED-COLUMN CONSISTENCY (every completed round's columns
  verify against its root) ∧ the IOR knowledge state on the SYNTHESIZED
  transcript. Empty: columns vacuous, collapses to `R_{≤δ}`. Prover moves:
  pending-blind. Full: collapses to accept-with-`R'_{≤δ}` — where "accept"
  now includes the opening checks.
* `accRbrKnowledgeSoundBcs` — Def 4.2 at the root alphabet, `extract_sound`
  PROVED: the extractor peels the round's message, synthesizes its word
  through the columns, and decodes at the canonical radius `δ⋆`
  (`decodeLink`, reused); the per-round `∃ w`-event refines into the SAME
  fold event `accSound_rbr` (CITED) prices — the falseness choreography of
  `AccRbrInstance` runs verbatim with the synthesized word in the sent
  word's place. `err = accRbrError`, no slack.
* `wAt_bcs` + `accRbrBcs_backward_committed` — the backward composition
  (Construction B.5) at the BCS alphabet is the IOR composition on the
  synthesized transcript (`wAt` commutes with `bcsRounds`), so on an honestly
  committed chain — roots committing the (masked) round words, columns
  verified, words in the code — it returns EXACTLY the committed word family,
  through binding, citing `accRbr_backward_masked`. The F₅ keystone
  `bcs_extract_is_seam` then identifies its output with
  `extractChain ∘ seamCounterfactual`'s on the landed instance
  (`seam_extraction_committed_F5`, CITED): the native BCS extractor IS the
  seam object, not a lookalike.
* `accFsSound_bcs` — `FsOfRbrSound` (PROVED, `fsKeystone_proved`) applied to
  the BCS pair: Fiat–Shamir OF THE DEPLOYED TRANSCRIPT SHAPE — the proof
  string carries roots + columns + proofs, and the oracle hashes those, not
  full words — is straightline knowledge-sound at `(t + k)·accRbrError`.

**Honest scope — what closes and what remains.** The BCS-alphabet quadruple —
root-and-columns messages, an opening-checking verifier, the
committed-column-consistent knowledge state, the binding-composed synthesis
extractor, `extract_sound` at the landed `accRbrError` price, and FS on top —
is BUILT and PROVED here, no sorry, no `Prop := True`. Its deployment
coverage is the WHOLE-CODE-MASK / UNIQUE-DECODING regime (`t ≥ d`), where the
per-round recommitted words are exactly the objects the ZK schedule may
commit and open (`seam_hiding_coexist_at_d`: at `t = d` the columns determine
the masked word AND hide the witness). What remains is `[ACC-rbr-bcs-resid]`,
named precisely at the bottom: (a) the FOLD-ROOT schedule — the constrained-
mask deployment opens columns of the recommitted PARTIAL FOLDS, whose roots
lag their challenge by one message (`h_{i+1}` is committed only after `ρ_i`),
while Defs 4.1/4.2 score `ρ_i` at round `i`'s extension; re-attributing the
knowledge state to the lagged fold roots needs either the BCS oracle-log
extraction (outside `Reduction`'s shape) or a claim-fold-satisfiability round
bound that is NOT the landed fixed-pair `accSound_rbr` event — the column
DATA is seam-equivalent (exhibited by `bcs_extract_is_seam`), the root
attribution is the open packaging; (b) the sub-unique-decoding seam for
constrained masks — `[ZK-RBR-extract]` open lemma A, inherited unchanged;
(c) the floor — `[FS-ROM]`/`[COMMIT-CR]`/`hPG`, inherited unchanged.

**Keystones** (F₅, landed objects REUSED): `accReductionBcs_F5`/`accRbrBcs_F5`
— the BCS instance BUILT on `goodChain` at `C = ⊤`, commitment
`CommitExample.S₅`, columns `qPair` at `t = d = 2`, every floor hypothesis
discharged by landed witnesses; `bcs_state_alive` (the state fires TRUE on
the FULL honest committed transcript — openings verified, fold synthesized,
aggregate satisfied); `bcs_err_computes` (`err ≡ 1/5`); `bcs_extract_masked`
(the backward composition returns the masked words exactly, any seed);
`bcs_extract_is_seam` (its output = `extractChain ∘ seamCounterfactual`
through `S₅` binding — the seam citation made real); `bcs_fs_fired` (FS at
the deployed alphabet, `(t + 2)·(1/5)`); `bcs_root_pins_word` +
`bcs_teeth_columns` (teeth: a reused root forces the SAME synthesized word
through binding — generic and computed). No `sorry`, no vacuous
`Prop := True`.

/-- **The Def-4.2 instance at the BCS alphabet** — `[ACC-rbr-bcs]`'s owed
quadruple: `kstate = accKStateBcs` (committed-column-consistent),
`extract = accExtractBcs` (synthesize the round word from the columns, decode
at the canonical radius `δ⋆`), `err = accRbrError` (the landed round price,
no slack), and `extract_sound` PROVED by the SAME refinement as the IOR
instance with the synthesized word in the sent word's place:

* a knowledge-state witness alive at the extended transcript carries the fold
  event at the fresh challenge on the SYNTHESIZED transcript
  (`chainWord_append`/`chainClaim_append` through `bcsRounds_append`);
* the extractor's output dead at the shorter transcript forces the falseness
  package `hfar` for the pair (synthesized running fold, synthesized round
  word) — the accumulator component or the decoder component;
* when neither doom holds the round event is EMPTY — the alive witness's
  column consistency restricts to the prefix and its remaining links rebuild
  the shorter state through the decoder.

The probability bound is `accSound_rbr` (CITED) verbatim; the mutual-CA floor
rides as hypotheses exactly as at the IOR resolution. -/

`bcs_teeth_columns` above shows binding refuting an equivocation at `S₅`. The
witnesses below are the other half of the same fact, and the half a collision
reduction actually needs: at a scheme with NO binding field the attempt is not
refuted, it is a built object, and the synthesized word is WRONG. -/

  root := ()

/-! ## Residual obligation — prose, not a stub

**What CLOSED here.** `[ACC-rbr-bcs]` named the BCS-resolution instance: a
`Reduction` whose `PMsg` is the deployed message alphabet (recommitted root +
opened columns + opening proofs), a `KStateFn` demanding committed-column
consistency, and an extract field synthesizing the round words from one
execution's columns through binding. ALL THREE are BUILT and PROVED here at
that alphabet — `accReductionBcs` (opening-checking verifier),
`accKStateBcs` (all three Def-4.1 clauses), `accRbrKnowledgeSoundBcs`
(`extract_sound` at the landed `accRbrError` price, `accSound_rbr` cited
never re-derived), `accFsSound_bcs` (FS of the deployed transcript shape at
`(t + k)·accRbrError`), with the backward composition returning the committed
(masked) words exactly (`accRbrBcs_backward_committed`, riding
`accRbr_backward_masked`) and IDENTIFIED with the seam object on the landed
instance (`bcs_extract_is_seam` = `extractChain ∘ seamCounterfactual` through
`S₅` binding, citing `seam_extraction_committed_F5`).

**`[ACC-rbr-bcs-resid]`** — what remains, stated precisely.

* **(a) The fold-root schedule.** This file's round message commits the
  round's OWN (masked) word — deployment-faithful for the WHOLE-CODE-MASK /
  unique-decoding regime (`t ≥ d`), where opening the recommitted round word
  is exactly the landed coexistence point (`seam_hiding_coexist_at_d`: the
  columns determine the masked word and hide the witness). The
  CONSTRAINED-mask deployment instead opens columns of the recommitted
  PARTIAL FOLDS, and those roots LAG their challenge: `h_{i+1} = h_i +
  ρ_i·w_i` can only be committed after `ρ_i`, i.e. inside round `i+1`'s
  message — while Defs 4.1/4.2 score challenge `ρ_i` at round `i`'s
  extension, where that root has not yet been sent. Re-attributing the
  knowledge state to the lagged fold roots therefore needs either (i) the
  BCS/ROM commitment extraction (read the committed word out of the oracle
  QUERY LOG at root time — outside `Reduction`'s oracle-free shape; the
  transcript-layer route), or (ii) a round bound for the event "the folded
  CLAIM is δ-satisfiable near an adversary-chosen point committed AFTER the
  challenge" — a claim-fold-satisfiability bound that is genuinely NOT the
  landed fixed-pair `accSound_rbr` event. The column DATA is equivalent
  either way (successive fold columns and increment columns interconvert by
  the seam's `γ⁻¹`-difference map — the same formula inside
  `seamCounterfactual`, and `bcs_extract_is_seam` exhibits this file's
  extractor equal to the seam's output); the ROOT attribution is the open
  packaging.
* **(b) Sub-unique-decoding.** For constrained masks (the homogeneous masks
  that make masked words witnesses) the seam must recover increments from
  `t ≤ d − r` columns — `[ZK-RBR-extract]` open lemma A, inherited unchanged.
* **(c) The floor.** `[FS-ROM]` (the sponge realizing the handler),
  `[COMMIT-CR]` (the Merkle/sponge scheme realizing `BindingCommitment`), and
  the standing `hPG` mutual-CA package at RS with macroscopic δ — inherited,
  consumed as hypotheses, never claimed.

**Where the ZK argument now stands, honestly.** `loom_zk_argument`'s RBR/FS
carrier exists at the root/column message alphabet with a committed-column
knowledge state and a binding-composed extractor — the deployed shape for the
whole-code-mask/UD regime, with proven parameters `(t + k)·(err⋆(δ) + 1/|F|)`
under the mutual-CA floor. It is NOT yet "deployed resolution, full stop":
the constrained-mask fold-root schedule (a) and lemma A (b) still gap, and
everything rides the floor (c). Nothing sharper is claimed.

  DEFINED/PROVED: the deployed message alphabet and its opening checks.
* `bcsWord` / `bcsWord_committed` — DEFINED/PROVED: per-message word

* `bcs_root_pins_word` — PROVED (teeth): one root, one column vector, one
  synthesized word.
* `bcsRounds` (+ `_length`, `_nil`, `_append`, `_ofFn`, `_take`) —
  DEFINED/PROVED: message transcripts read as word transcripts.
* `accReductionBcs` — DEFINED: the chain as a WARP `Reduction` at
  `PMsg = BcsMsg`, verifier checking every opening.
* `AccStatePropBcs` / `accKStateBcs` (+ `_state_eq`) — DEFINED, all three
  Def-4.1 clauses PROVED: committed-column consistency ∧ the IOR state on the
  synthesized transcript.
* `accExtractBcs` (+ `_append`) — DEFINED/PROVED: synthesize the round word,
  decode at the canonical radius.
* `accRbrKnowledgeSoundBcs` — BUILT, `extract_sound` PROVED via
  `accSound_rbr` (CITED): Def 4.2 at the deployed alphabet,
  `err = accRbrError`, no slack.
* `wAt_bcs` / `accRbrBcs_backward_committed` — PROVED: Construction B.5 at
  the BCS alphabet = the IOR composition on the synthesized transcript;
  committed chains extract exactly (`accRbr_backward_masked` CITED).
* `accFsSound_bcs` — PROVED: FS of the deployed transcript shape,
  straightline, `(t + k)·accRbrError`.
* Keystones — `accReductionBcs_F5` / `accRbrBcs_F5` (built, landed
  witnesses); `msgBcs` + `msgBcs_opens` + `msgBcs_word`; `bcs_state_alive`
  (the state fires on the FULL honest committed transcript);
  `bcs_err_computes` (`1/5`); `bcs_extract_masked` (the masked words, any
  seed); `bcs_extract_is_seam` (= `extractChain ∘ seamCounterfactual`
  through binding, `seam_extraction_committed_F5` CITED); `bcs_fs_fired`
  (FS at the deployed alphabet); `bcs_root_pins_F5` + `bcs_teeth_columns`
  (teeth, generic + computed).
* Residual — `[ACC-rbr-bcs-resid]` (prose above): (a) the constrained-mask
  fold-root schedule (lagged recommitment attribution), (b) lemma A, (c) the
  floor — each inherited or named, none silently absorbed.
