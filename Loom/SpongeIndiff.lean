# Loom.SpongeIndiff — sponge indifferentiability: the LAST floor reduction,
# [FS-ROM] → (ideal permutation + proximity)

`Loom/FiatShamir.lean` names `[FS-ROM]` as "the one named idealization": the
deployed sponge/hash realizes the lazy-sampling `Oracle` handler.
`Loom/CollisionResistanceROM.lean` already moved the CR leg of `[COMMIT-CR]`
into the ROM with a number. This file builds the machinery that reduces
`[FS-ROM]` itself one floor down: the SPONGE construction over an ideal
permutation is indifferentiable from a random oracle up to the capacity bound
`O(q²/2^c)` — so the floor consolidates to (ideal permutation + proximity).

What lands here, PROVED:
* **The sponge** (`spongeAbsorb`/`sponge`): absorb rate-blocks into a
  `Rate × Cap` state through a permutation `P`, squeeze the final rate. The
  deployed candidate for `P` is `Compiler/AirHash.lean`'s `permExec`
  (Poseidon2-shape) — cited by NAME, not imported: the Loom boundary
  (`scripts/check-import-boundary.sh`) forbids `Compiler` imports, so the
  sponge is parametric over `P` and the tie to `permExec` is instantiation.
* **The partial walk** (`walkFrom`): the sponge's absorb phase run THROUGH a
  partial permutation log — `Loom/FiatShamir.lean`'s `Oracle` structure,
  reused verbatim, with two new handler laws (`Oracle.lookup_mem`,
  `Oracle.lookup_respond_some`, `Oracle.invert_respond`). `walkFrom_agrees`:
  on a log consistent with a total `P`, the walk IS `spongeAbsorb`.
* **The simulator** (`simFwd`/`simInv`, dispatched by `spongeSimulator`) — the
  standard indifferentiability simulator, genuinely maintaining consistency:
  ONE shared log for both query directions; forward queries that COMPLETE a
  rooted absorption path (`completion?` — the unique-path detector) are
  answered by PROGRAMMING the RO's value into the rate and a fresh coin into
  the capacity; unrooted forward queries and inverse queries answer fresh
  coins. Replay/frame/consistency laws come free from the LANDED handler laws
  (`respond_hit`, `respond_consistent`, `lookup_respond_self`) — the
  simulator is `Oracle.respond` with a computed value, not a new handler.
* **`walk_programs` — the programming keystone**: at the moment a fresh
  forward query completes rooted path `m`, the FULL sponge walk of `m`
  through the extended log succeeds and squeezes EXACTLY the programmed rate
  (the RO's answer at `m`). This is the real/ideal agreement at the
  construction interface, one step, machine-checked for every log, state, and
  message. `sponge_realizes_handler_step` restates it with the RO as the
  landed lazy-sampling handler and adds `respond_consistent`: a later
  construction query of `m` answers the SAME value — the exact seam
  `[FS-ROM]` names, closed one step at a time.
* **Path-uniqueness preservation** (`uniquePaths_simFwd`/`uniquePaths_simInv`
  via `uniquePaths_respond_freshOut`/`_freshKey`): the simulator's path
  bookkeeping stays UNIQUE after every step whose fresh capacity coin misses
  `capsOf` (every capacity the log or IV mentions) — the walk-decomposition
  lemma `walkFrom_respond_split` shows a new entry can only ever be the LAST
  step of a path, and only extend THE unique rooted prefix. This is the
  simulator's consistency-off-the-bad-event, per step, proved.
* **The capacity-collision bad event, PRICED** (`CapBad`, `capBad_bound`,
  `capBad_le`): fresh capacity coins pairwise collide or hit a fixed avoid
  set. Pairwise part = the LANDED `birthday_bound` (cited through the
  transport `capCollisionProb_eq`, not re-derived); hit part = a union bound
  over coordinates, per-coordinate the LANDED `uniformProb_coord_mem`
  (`Loom/Sumcheck.lean`, its unused `Field` binder dropped there — cited, not
  re-derived). Total: `≤ q(q−1)/(2N) + q·|S|/N ≤ 2q²/N` for
  `|S| ≤ q + 1` — the `O(q²/2^c)` capacity bound with explicit constants.
  Tight at `q = 2` (`capBad_two_prob` = `1/N`, the bound's value there).
* **The game, STATED PRECISELY** (`SpongeIndifferentiable`,
  `SpongeIndiffGame` = `[SPONGE-indiff-game]`): a `q`-query adaptive
  distinguisher (the `SrProver` adaptivity shape) against REAL = (sponge over
  a uniformly random `Equiv.Perm`, the permutation both ways) vs IDEAL = (the
  lazy-sampling RO handler, the simulator); advantage `≤ 2q²/|Cap| + q²/|Blk|`
  (capacity bad event + permutation-vs-function switching). `q = 0` slice
  PROVED (`advantage_zero_queries`) — the game machinery computes.

## Covered scope, in the same sentence as the claim (the honest label)
The simulator, its programming correctness, its per-step path-uniqueness
preservation, and the capacity-collision bound are PROVED — for every log,
every step, non-adaptive avoid-set (`CapBad` takes a FIXED `S`, mirroring
`Loom/CollisionResistanceROM.lean`'s non-adaptive covered scope). The
distinguisher-advantage inequality itself — folding the per-step lemmas along
`idealRun`, tying `CapBad`'s avoid set to the adaptively-grown `capsOf`, and
the identical-until-bad comparison of the two runs — is `[SPONGE-indiff-game]`,
stated as a real quantified `Prop` below and NOT proved. Single-rate-block
squeeze; nonempty unpadded messages (`SpQuery.constr` carries `x :: xs`);
multi-block squeeze and the deployed padding rule are `[SPONGE-padding]`.

## Keystones (ATLAS: satisfiable + teeth + premise inhabitation, BUILT)
`SpongeExample`: over `ZMod 2 × Fin 2`, the FIRST forward query at the IV
capacity is rate-completing with completed message `[a]` (computed through
`completion?_empty_iv`), the simulator programs `H [a]` into it, the walk
squeezes it back, the second identical query REPLAYS it, and path uniqueness
survives the step; teeth — two RO's differing at the completed message force
DIFFERENT simulator answers (`simFwd_reads_H`: the programming is
load-bearing), and the capacity-collision event is exhibited (`capBad_pair`),
has probability EXACTLY `1/N` at two queries (`capBad_two_prob` — the bound
ATTAINED, not slack), and is nonempty (`capBad_two_pos`).

/-! ## §3 Rooted paths and the completion detector.

A capacity `c` is ROOTED in a log if some message's partial walk from the IV
reaches a state with capacity `c`. A forward query at a rooted capacity
COMPLETES an absorption: it is the last permutation call of the message
`m ++ [s.1 − b]` (where `(b, c)` is the rooted state) — exactly the calls the
honest sponge makes. `completion?` detects this; it programs only when the
path is UNIQUE (off the capacity-collision bad event it always is — §5). -/

`H m` (the RO programmed into the squeeze position) and a fresh capacity coin;

/-! ## §5 Path-uniqueness preservation — the simulator's consistency OFF the
bad event, per step.

The bad event is a fresh capacity hitting `capsOf` — any capacity the log
(inputs AND outputs) or the IV mentions. Off it, a new entry can only be the
LAST step of a rooted path (`walkFrom_respond_split`: nothing continues from
the fresh output capacity), and can only extend THE unique rooted prefix — so
`UniquePaths` survives every simulator step, in both query directions. -/

`q` fresh capacity coins go bad if two collide (birthday — the LANDED

fixed avoid set `S` (union bound over coordinates, each priced by the LANDED
`uniformProb_coord_mem` of `Loom/Sumcheck.lean` — cited, not re-derived).
Covered scope,
mirroring `Loom/CollisionResistanceROM.lean`: NON-ADAPTIVE — `S` is fixed

/-! ## §9 Residual ledger — prose, not stubs.

**What CLOSED here.** (1) The sponge and its partial walk, with the real
world's reading (`walkFrom_agrees`). (2) THE SIMULATOR — the genuine
construction: one shared log, RO-programming on rate-completing queries
(`completion?`, unique-path–guarded), consistency inherited verbatim from the
landed handler laws, forward/inverse coherence both ways (`simInv_lookup`,
`simInv_inverts`). (3) `walk_programs` — the programming keystone: the sponge
walk of a completed message through the simulator's log squeezes exactly the
RO's answer, for every log/state/message; `sponge_realizes_handler_step`
re-renders it against the landed lazy-sampling handler with replay. (4)
Path-uniqueness preservation per step, BOTH directions, off capacity-freshness
(`uniquePaths_simFwd`, `uniquePaths_simInv`, via the walk-decomposition lemma).
(5) The capacity-collision bad event PRICED: `capBad_bound` (sharp),
`capBad_le` (`≤ 2q²/|Cap|`), birthday CITED from
`Loom/CollisionResistanceROM.lean`, tight at `q = 2`. (6) The game — both
worlds and the advantage statement — STATED precisely, with the `q = 0` slice
proved.

**`[SPONGE-indiff-game]`** — the genuinely-remaining mass, named as the real
`Prop` `SpongeIndiffGame`: the run-level assembly. Concretely owed: (i) the
run induction — fold `uniquePaths_simFwd`/`uniquePaths_simInv` and
`walk_programs` along `idealRun`, maintaining "every completed path's walk
agrees with the RO handler" as a run invariant (each per-step lemma is proved
above; the induction must thread `capsOf`'s growth); (ii) the schedule bridge
— `CapBad` takes a FIXED avoid set, but `capsOf` grows adaptively: the same
per-step conditioning machinery `Loom/CollisionResistanceROM.lean` already
names `[CR-ROM-adaptive]` (one shared debt, not a new one); (iii)
identical-until-bad — off `CapBad`, coupling the ideal run to the real run
(through the random-function hybrid; the RP/RF switch is the `q²/|Blk|` term
in the stated bound). Nothing in (i)–(iii) is conjectural mathematics — it is
standard game-hopping (Bertoni–Daemen–Peeters–Van Assche 2008) awaiting
formalization mass.

**`[SPONGE-padding]`** — single-rate-block squeeze, nonempty unpadded
messages; the deployed injective padding rule and multi-block squeeze are
instantiation, owed with `[AIR-poseidon-params]`.

**`[PERM-ideal]`** — the NEW floor this file consolidates onto: the deployed
permutation (`Compiler/AirHash.lean`'s `permExec` at the deployed Poseidon2
parameters — cited by name; the Loom import boundary keeps it out of this
tree) behaves as a uniformly random `Equiv.Perm` — the real world's coin. This
replaces `[FS-ROM]`'s monolithic "the sponge realizes the handler": once
`[SPONGE-indiff-game]` closes, `[FS-ROM]` = `[PERM-ideAL]` + this file's
theorems + MRH composition (the composition theorem is folded into the game
residual — the game statement is already the composable form). The floor then
reads: **ideal permutation + proximity**.

## Ledger

* `sponge`/`spongeAbsorb`/`walkFrom`(+laws)/`walkFrom_agrees` — the
  construction and its partial-log spine.
* `IsPath`/`UniquePaths`/`completion?`(+spec/empty) — rooted paths and the
  completion detector.
* `simFwd`/`simInv`/`spongeSimulator`(+replay/program/unrooted/consistency/
  inverse laws)/`simFwd_reads_H` — THE simulator, teeth included.
* `walk_programs`/`simFwd_walk`/`sponge_realizes_handler_step` — the
  programming keystone; the `[FS-ROM]` seam closed one step at a time.
* `capsOf`/`walkFrom_respond_split`/`uniquePaths_respond_freshOut`/
  `uniquePaths_respond_freshKey`/`uniquePaths_simFwd`/`uniquePaths_simInv` —
  consistency off the bad event, per step, both directions.
* `CapBad`/`capBad_bound`/`capBad_le`(+`capCollisionProb_eq` transport,
  `capBad_two_prob` tightness) — the `O(q²/2^c)` capacity price, birthday
  cited.
* `Distinguisher`/`realRun`/`realProb`/`IdealState`/`simFwdRO`/`idealRun`/
  `idealProb`/`SpongeIndifferentiable`/`SpongeIndiffGame` — the game, stated;
  `advantage_zero_queries` the proved slice.
* Keystones — `SpongeExample.*`: the concrete two-query run of the simulator
  (completion computed, programming, walk-back, replay, teeth, invariant,
  inverse coherence) and the priced bad event, exact at `1/2`.
* Residuals — `[SPONGE-indiff-game]` (run assembly; shares
  `[CR-ROM-adaptive]`'s schedule machinery), `[SPONGE-padding]`,
  `[PERM-ideal]` (the new floor) — all prose above, none a `True` stub. -/
