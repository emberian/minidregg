# Loom.SpongeIndiffWorkBudget — count construction primitive calls honestly

`Distinguisher q` counts external interface queries.  A construction query
`.constr x xs`, however, evaluates one primitive call for every block in
`x :: xs`.  Thus external query count is not in general the primitive-query
budget used by the sponge capacity and permutation/function switching bounds.

This module adds the missing first-order work accounting.  It proves an exact
counterexample to treating `q` as primitive work, proves that the old count is
sound on the explicit single-block construction fragment, and states the
honest work-indexed indifferentiability target.  It does not prove the game
hop; the lazy primitive construction runner and its coupling are the next
semantic layer.
