# Loom.JohnsonMcaBridge — exact interface to the 2025 RS/MCA theorems

This module records the small, proof-theoretically honest bridge from the
published Reed--Solomon mutual-correlated-agreement statements to Loom's
`WHIRConjecture412` interface.  It does **not** assert the algebraic theorem.
Instead, `HaboeckTheorem2` names its exact finite bad-slope conclusion and the
headline theorems below consume that conclusion as an explicit hypothesis.

Primary sources:

* U. Haböck, *A note on mutual correlated agreement for Reed--Solomon codes*,
  ePrint 2025/2110, Theorem 2.
* S. Bordage, A. Chiesa, Z. Guan, I. Manzur, *All Polynomial Generators
  Preserve Distance with Mutual Correlated Agreement*, ePrint 2025/2051 / CCC
  2026, Theorem 5 (the affine-line specialization).

Haböck writes `RS[F,D,k]` for polynomials of degree at most `k`, hence its
dimension is `k+1`. Loom's `reedSolomonCode dom d` uses degree `< d`, so the
paper's deliberately reduced rate is

`rho_H = k/n = (d-1)/n`,

not Loom/WHIR's rounded dimension rate `rho_J = d/n`. For an integer
multiplicity `m >= 3`, Haböck sets

`gamma_m = 1 - (1 + 1/(2m)) * sqrt rho`,
`ell_m   = (m + 1/2) / sqrt rho`,

and proves that the number of bad slopes is at most

`(ell_m^7 / 3) * (rho*n)^2`.

Dividing by `|F|` is exactly Loom's uniform affine-generator probability.  As
`m -> infinity`, `gamma_m` approaches the Johnson radius `1 - sqrt rho` from
below.  `HaboeckErrorEnvelope` is the precise remaining arithmetic choice of
`m` at every requested radius; it also prevents an invalid upgrade from the
paper's explicit error to an arbitrary error function.

The hard unformalized core is not this bridge.  It is Haböck's adaptation of
BCIKS: Guruswami--Sudan interpolation over `F(Z)`, factorization into
separable/inseparable components, a discriminant specialization, Hensel
lifting, and the useful-factor argument identifying a codeword line.  Keeping
that core in the single proposition `HaboeckTheorem2` makes the dependency
visible without changing `Loom.JohnsonRegime` or any root import.
