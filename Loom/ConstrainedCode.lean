# Loom.ConstrainedCode — the WHIR constrained Reed–Solomon code (Def 4.5): the
claim object the accumulator folds.

WHIR (eprint 2024/1586) Definition 4.5:
`CRS[F, L, m, ŵ, σ] := { f ∈ RS[F, L, m] : Σ_{b ∈ {0,1}^m} ŵ(f̂(b), b) = σ }` —
a Reed–Solomon codeword whose multilinear extension `f̂` additionally satisfies a
weighted sum constraint. `CRS[F, L, m, 0, 0] = RS[F, L, m]` (unconstrained), the
evaluation claim `f̂(z) = σ` is the weight `ŵ(Z, X) = Z·eq(z, X)`, and the
multi-constrained code is the intersection over a list `((ŵᵢ, σᵢ))ᵢ`.

**v0 representation decision (stated, not hidden).** For the PCS instantiation
WHIR needs only the LINEAR weight class `ŵ(Z, X) = Z·â(X)`, under which the
constraint is a linear functional of the codeword: `Σ_b f̂(b)·â(b)` is linear in
`f` (the coefficient/MLE map and the weighted hypercube sum are both linear). So
minidregg's constraint channel is `LinearConstraint`: a weight vector
`wt : ι → F` on the evaluation domain plus a target, satisfaction being
`⟨f, wt⟩ = Σᵢ wt i * f i = target`. This LOSES NOTHING within the linear class:
`exists_dotWt_eq` PROVES every linear functional on `ι → F` has this form
(finite-dimensional representation along the coordinate basis), so any linear-ŵ
constraint — in particular any MLE weighted sum, once transported through the
fixed linear coefficient map — lands in this channel. What v0 does NOT model is
NONLINEAR ŵ (the general Σ-IOP weights of WHIR §5.1); that is future vocabulary,
out of scope for the PCS/accumulator floor, and this file never claims it. The
domain-point evaluation claim `f(pt) = σ` is the instance `evalConstraint`
(`satisfies_evalConstraint_iff`), the discrete `Z·eq` weight.

This is docs/LOOM-RECOMPOSITION.md §6's constraint channel: "points + targets,
γ-linear in both" — `LinearConstraint` is the channel entry, and γ-linearity in
both components is exactly what `batchConstraint` exercises.

**What is proved here (no sorry, no axioms):**

* `constrainedRS_nil`: the empty constraint list gives back exactly the RS code —
  Def 4.5's `CRS[…, 0, 0] = RS`.
* `constrainedRS_subset_code`: constraints only shrink (every constrained code
  sits inside `reedSolomonCode`); `constrainedRS_anti`: more constraints, smaller
  code.
* `constrainedRS_append`: concatenating constraint lists intersects the codes —
  multi-constraint = intersection, the closure the accumulator's claim-merging
  needs (two CRS claims on ONE word over ONE code merge to a CRS claim).
* **γ-power batching, completeness direction (WHIR Constr. 5.5)**:
  `satisfies_batch_of_forall` — a word satisfying all `t` constraints satisfies
  the single γ-batched constraint `⟨f, Σₖ γᵏ·wtₖ⟩ = Σₖ γᵏ·σₖ`, for EVERY γ. Pure
  linear algebra (`dotWt` linearity down a Horner spine). Code-level form:
  `constrainedRS_subset_batch`. Closed γ-power forms of the Horner definitions:
  `batchWt_eq_sum`, `batchTarget_eq_sum` — the paper-verbatim `Σ γ^{k}·(·)ₖ`.
* **Exact-word batching soundness (Schwartz–Zippel teeth)**:
  `card_batch_satisfying_le` — if the word VIOLATES some constraint of the list,
  then at most `t − 1` choices of `γ ∈ F` make the batched constraint pass: the
  defect polynomial `Σₖ (⟨f, wtₖ⟩ − σₖ)·Xᵏ` is nonzero of degree `< t`, root
  counting as in `ReedSolomon.card_agreeSet_lt_of_ne`. Over uniform γ this is
  error `(t−1)/|F|` for exact words.

**What stays prose-residual — `[CRS-batch-sound]`:** WHIR Constr. 5.5's full
round-by-round soundness is the PROXIMITY statement: a word δ-CLOSE to the
γ-batched code (for more than a `(t−1)·ℓ/|F|` fraction of γ, ℓ the list size at
radius δ in the mutual-correlated-agreement regime) is δ-close to the
multi-constrained code. That needs the list-decoding/mutual-CA machinery of
`Loom/CorrelatedAgreement.lean` wired to constrained codes and is FUTURE WORK,
carried here only as prose (per the ReedSolomon.lean precedent for Thm 4.8:
naming a Prop we can't yet inhabit responsibly would be faking; the exact-word
theorem above is the machine-checked kernel of the same argument — same defect
polynomial, same root count — the residual is the lift from exact membership to
δ-proximity). No axiom, no placeholder instance.
⟲ STATUS: the lift is now a THEOREM in `Loom/AccSound.lean`
(`accSound_batch_proximity`: `(t−1)·ℓ/|F|` with the δ-ball list size ℓ as
hypothesis, union bound over the list priced by this file's kernel;
`accSound_batch_proximity_UD`: ℓ = 1 discharged at unique decoding). What
remains of `[CRS-batch-sound]` is supplying ℓ in the beyond-UD regimes —
`[ACC-sound-list]` in that file's ledger.

**Keystone hygiene (ATLAS: satisfiable + teeth, BUILT):** over `F₅` on
`RSExample`'s 4-point domain, `CRSExample.xWord_mem_constrainedRS` exhibits a
concrete codeword IN a concretely-constrained code (an evaluation claim,
`decide`-checked); `CRSExample.zero_mem_code_not_constrained` exhibits a word in
the RS code but NOT in the constrained one (the shrink is STRICT:
`constrainedRS_ssubset_example`). The batch bound is exercised TIGHTLY: for the
violating word, exactly `1 = t − 1` of the 5 possible γ satisfy the batch
(`batch_teeth_card_eq`), so `card_batch_satisfying_le` is attained, not slack.

− batched target). If `f` violates some constraint, it is a NONZERO polynomial
of degree `< t`, so at most `t − 1` challenges γ let the batch pass — over
uniform γ, error `(t−1)/|F|` for EXACT words. The lift from exact membership to

  rcases hc with rfl | rfl <;> decide

/-- Concrete non-vacuity of the batch: at the specific challenge `γ = 3` the
batched constraint is verified by computation. -/
example : Satisfies xWord (batchConstraint 3 [evalC, evalC₂]) := by decide

/-- **Batch-soundness TEETH, tight**: the zero word violates `evalC`; exactly
ONE of the 5 challenges (γ = 2, where `1 + 2γ = 0`) lets the batch of
`[evalC, evalC₂]` pass — the `t − 1 = 1` bound of `card_batch_satisfying_le`
is ATTAINED, not slack. -/
theorem batch_teeth_card_eq :
    (Finset.univ.filter fun γ : ZMod 5 =>
        Satisfies (0 : Fin 4 → ZMod 5) (batchConstraint γ [evalC, evalC₂])).card
      = 1 := by decide

/-- The general soundness bound fired on the same data: `≤ t − 1 = 1`. -/
example :
    (Finset.univ.filter fun γ : ZMod 5 =>
        Satisfies (0 : Fin 4 → ZMod 5) (batchConstraint γ [evalC, evalC₂])).card
