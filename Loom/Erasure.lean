# Loom.Erasure — [ACC-extract-bind](b): from `t` opened columns to the FULL
folded codeword.

`Loom/Commitment.lean` closed `[ACC-extract-bind]`(a)+(c) — binding and
attribution — AT THE RESOLUTION where every position of the word is opened
(`∀ i, verifyOpen …`). In deployment the prover opens only `t` spot-checked
columns (WARP App. B); obligation (b) of that seam's ledger is the lift from
those `t` opened SYMBOLS to the FULL committed word. This file closes (b) for
the unique-decoding regime `t ≥ d`: a Reed–Solomon codeword is an MDS code, so
`d` of its symbols at distinct positions determine the whole word by
Lagrange/Vandermonde interpolation — the SAME machinery `Loom/ZKHiding.lean`
already proved for the masking layer, REUSED here rather than re-derived —
so `t ≥ d` opened columns recover it exactly.

**The argument, in the landed vocabulary:**

* RS is MDS (`Loom/ZKHiding.lean`): `exists_codeword_open` — any `t ≤ d`
  symbol values at distinct points are the opening of SOME codeword
  (Lagrange interpolation); `open_determines` — `d ≤ t` opened symbols of TWO
  codewords force them equal EVERYWHERE, not merely at the queried points
  (root counting on the difference polynomial, `card_agreeSet_lt_of_ne`).
  `open_determines` at `t = d` is exactly "the whole word is a function of
  `d` of its symbols" — the theorem this file turns into an actual
  reconstruction function.
* `recoverFromColumns` builds that function: Lagrange-interpolate the
  degree-`< d` polynomial through the FIRST `d` of the `t` opened symbols
  (`Fin.castLE`), then evaluate it across the whole domain
  (`Loom/ReedSolomon.lean`'s `evalOnDomain`). `recoverFromColumns_sound`
  proves it recovers the genuine word whenever the input actually came from
  one — the interpolated word agrees with `f` at the `d` points it was built
  from (`Lagrange.eval_interpolate_at_node`), and `open_determines` upgrades
  that `d`-point agreement to FULL word equality.
* `committed_word_recovered` connects to `Loom/Commitment.lean`: given a
  `BindingCommitment` whose root commits a genuine codeword `w`, and `t ≥ d`
  VERIFIED openings at distinct positions, `recoverFromColumns` on the
  verified data returns `w` — binding (that the verified values ARE `w`'s
  symbols, via `S.binding` against `verifyOpen_of_commit_eq`) composed with
  erasure recovery (that those symbols determine `w`). This is
  `[ACC-extract-bind]`(b): the witness word whose openings AccExtract's
  algebra runs on, once opened at only `t` spot checks, is still THE word
  the root binds.

**What stays outside this file — `[ERASURE-list]`:** everything here is the
UNIQUE-decoding regime, `t ≥ d`, where the opened symbols pin down AT MOST
ONE codeword (and `recoverFromColumns` computes it whenever a genuine one
exists — `recoverFromColumns_mem` shows the output is always at least a
genuine low-degree codeword, whatever the input, so the machinery never lies
about its type even off the sound regime). Beyond unique decoding — a word
only δ-CLOSE to the code, in the Johnson list-decoding regime — `t` columns
may sit in the agreement sets of SEVERAL codewords at once, and picking one
needs the mutual-correlated-agreement machinery of
`Loom/CorrelatedAgreement.lean` (already PROVED for RS at the
unique-decoding radius, `Loom/ReedSolomon.lean`'s Corollary 4.11) plus the
list-enumeration wiring `Loom/OutOfDomain.lean` flags as prose,
`[OOD-pin-proximity]`. That lift is real future work, entered here as
NEITHER a hypothesis NOR an axiom — this file's theorems require the
openings to literally BE symbols of a codeword already in the code, which is
exactly what `committed_word_recovered` gets for free from binding, not from
an assumed proximity bound.

/-! ## Residual — prose, not a stub

**[ERASURE-list]** — beyond unique decoding (`t < d`, or a word merely
δ-close to the code rather than genuinely IN it), the opened symbols may sit
in the agreement sets of SEVERAL codewords: `recoverFromColumns_teeth`
exhibits exactly this ambiguity at `t = d − 1`. Picking out the single
intended codeword in that regime is the Johnson-list-decoding machinery:
`Loom/CorrelatedAgreement.lean`'s mutual correlated agreement (PROVED at the
unique-decoding radius, `Loom/ReedSolomon.lean` Corollary 4.11) plus the
list-enumeration wiring `Loom/OutOfDomain.lean` flags as
`[OOD-pin-proximity]`. This file's theorems never invoke that machinery as a
hypothesis — `committed_word_recovered` gets its "genuine codeword" premise
for free from `BindingCommitment` binding (the prover's committed word IS in
the code by the accumulator's own claim, not merely close to it), not from
an assumed proximity bound, so nothing here is priced on an unproved regime.

## Ledger

* `recoverFromColumns` — the erasure-decoder: interpolate `d` of the `t`
  opened columns, evaluate on the whole domain; junk `0` outside `d ≤ t`.
* `recoverFromColumns_mem` — always a genuine low-degree codeword.
* `recoverFromColumns_sound` — **THE theorem**: `t ≥ d` distinct opened
  columns of a genuine codeword recover it EXACTLY (full word equality),
  via `Loom/ZKHiding.lean`'s `open_determines` (root-counting injectivity) —
  REUSED, not re-derived.
* `committed_word_recovered` — `[ACC-extract-bind]`(b) closed: composes
  `BindingCommitment` position-binding with `recoverFromColumns_sound`.
* Keystones — satisfiable (`xWord_recovered`, `xWord_recovered_unopened`,
  `committed_recovered_fires`), teeth (`recoverFromColumns_teeth`,
  `recoverFromColumns_junk_outside_regime`), premise inhabitation
  (`opened₂_inj`: distinct positions at `t = d`).
* Residual — `[ERASURE-list]` (prose above); rides
  `Loom/CorrelatedAgreement.lean` + `Loom/OutOfDomain.lean`'s
  `[OOD-pin-proximity]`, never assumed here. -/
