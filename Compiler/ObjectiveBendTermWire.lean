/- The checker's decoder inverts the front end's rendering of a term.

The front end renders the elaborator's annotated term as JSON (`ATerm.json`) inside the
typing packet, and the checker reads that packet with its own decoder
(`ObjectiveBendTyping.decodeTerm`). `decode_json` proves the two meet: on a term of nesting
depth at most the decoder's fuel, decoding the rendering yields exactly the erasure
(`ATerm.erase`) of the elaborator's term. `decodePacket_term` says the term a decoded
packet carries is the decoding of its `term` field. Together they let
`ObjectiveBendFrontEnd.accept` carry `packet.source.term = erased` as a proof.

The JSON object lookups go through `Std.TreeMap.Raw.getElem?_ofList_of_mem`: every
rendered object has literally distinct keys. -/
