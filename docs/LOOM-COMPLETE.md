# Loom: what is complete, at which boundary

Status: 2026-08-09.

Loom is substantial machine-checked mathematics plus several real Lean-owned controllers. It is
not one deployed succinct ZK proof system. This document replaces earlier uses of “complete” that
collapsed ideal theorems, verifier gadgets, native experiments, and deployment into one label.

## Boundary legend

| Level | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **S** | semantic/formal carrier, theorem, or exact reduction interface |
| **A** | Lean-owned controller/admission over bytes or error |
| **P** | concrete cryptographic proof/security game and priced error |
| **D** | authenticated deployment and consumer cutover |
| **B** | reproducible matched-workload benchmark |

Current Loom is strongest at **S**, has concrete **A** seams, has conditional **P** shapes, and has
not yet reached an end-to-end **P/D/B** proof-system claim.

## Machine-checked formal core — S

### Reed–Solomon, accumulation, and extraction

- constrained RS claims, same-word batching, cross-word affine folding, exact/UD soundness, and
  arbitrary-depth chain extraction are local Lean theorems;
- light-client, RBR, Fiat–Shamir, and grinding results hold at their stated oracle/commitment and
  rate interfaces;
- commitment/extraction examples make binding premises load-bearing rather than hiding them; and
- semantic history uses the same `AccClaim` carrier rather than a structural hash-chain lookalike.

This does not instantiate a concrete PCS, ROM, commitment, or succinct verifier.

### Sumcheck and derived arithmetization

- `Loom/Sumcheck` and multilinear-extension modules prove the algebraic layer;
- `Compiler/Air` proves the circuit fold and executor readings agree;
- `AirFlatten` derives degree-≤2 gates with forced auxiliary wires;
- assurance modules retire linear and quadratic gate faces at their theorem interfaces; and
- `Compiler/Emit` produces first-order descriptor data with `emit_faithful`.

This proves what a descriptor means. It does not prove that Rust implements the descriptor or that
an external proof system soundly proves it.

### Multiplicative proximity and rate regimes

- the unique-decoding core and unconditional band `0 < δ < (1-ρ)/3` are proved;
- one threshold-halving round has at most one bad field challenge before a proved UD tail;
- committed coherent runtime-shaped query paths and their miss price are formalized; and
- the rate-1/2 `3/10 → 3/20 < 1/6` specialization is checked.

Concrete Merkle CR/binding and one-execution Fiat–Shamir/ROM composition remain **P** work.

### Johnson/list regime

`JohnsonRegime` proves the list-size inequality and sampling amplification. `JohnsonMcaBridge`
matches the exact published theorem interface and corrects the degree/rate convention. The hard
BCIKS/GS/Hensel algebra remains the explicit proposition `HaboeckTheorem2`, not a locally proved
theorem or hidden axiom. Capacity-level variants have counterexamples; no blanket capacity claim is
made.

### GF(2) tower and additive proximity

- Lean constructs the binary towers, embeddings, Fan–Paar basis/trace facts, and fast multiplication;
- the exact recursive low/high 32-byte Tower256 codec is proved;
- additive domains, novel-basis transforms, quotient folds, coherent queries, and adaptive
  earliest-deviation bounds are proved; and
- the characteristic-two clause binds exact basis order, affine domain, rate schedule,
  roots-before-challenges, queries, terminal, and ideal UD predicate.

The multiplicative theorem is not silently reused for the additive protocol.

### Zero knowledge and straight-line extraction

Formal games include constrained masking, multi-round/triangular hiding, straight-line extraction,
and repaired OracleLog linked-target assembly. The current linked construction freezes checked root
preimages before domain-separated queries and exposes shared-ROM fresh/hit/sampling ports.

These are real formal-game results. They do not mean the current runtime is a succinct NIZK. A
concrete hiding deployment still needs proof of committed-word knowledge, opening binding,
shared-ROM composition, and concrete ZK errors.

### Error budgets

The repository proves exact arithmetic for candidate formulas, including the BabyBear⁶ expression
in `(2^-138, 2^-137]`. The old 55-bit BabyBear⁴ expression and old recursive-verifier gadget are
historical results for deleted paths. A candidate formula is not a deployed security level until
the actual controller, fields, PCS, commitments, oracle, PoW, and common game match it.

## Lean-owned controllers — A

### Tower256 additive FRI

The shared backend fixes exact Lean Tower256, cSHAKE256 framing/output, and perfect-tree Merkle
relations. The deterministic controller:

- accepts only arbitrary native bytes or an opaque error;
- decodes proof bytes in Lean;
- derives roots-before-challenges transcript draws and coherent query seeds;
- checks exact Merkle openings, fold equations, and final polynomial; and
- reaches `AdditiveFriAdaptiveCoherentAccepts` and can issue the accepted sample token.

One controller-game coin owns schedule and ledger. This closes **A**, not deployed **P**.

Open **P/D/B** obligations:

- concrete instantiation of the supplied same-coin cover into additive proximity, commitment
  binding, or oracle transport;
- concrete PositionBinding and cSHAKE collision-resistance price;
- cSHAKE→ROM transport and far-word/proximity Fiat–Shamir reduction;
- emitted executable checker for the currently noncomputable Tower relation;
- proof/container/domain/level codecs and authenticated work IDs; and
- matched end-to-end prover/verifier benchmarks.

### Tower256 indexed LogUp

Exact Boolean-address decoding, unit-vector incidence, table pushforward, semantic roots, and indexed
evaluation are proved. The extension-local clause-404 dispatcher fixes the clause/controller/
backend/transcript identity and accepts exactly two uniquely keyed byte replies. Wrong counts,
duplicates, missing replies, native errors, or Lean plan failure block. Successful control retains
the existing proof-relevant `VerifiedExecution`.

Clause 404 remains absent from base V1 and deployment. Position binding, concrete PCS/sampled
decider, CR/ROM, mutable RAM, native artifact work profile, history evidence, and common-game budget
remain.

### Ext6 gate proof

`GateFactoredExt6` proves descriptor residual provenance, seven factored operands, degree-two
rounds, public affine terminal forms, and eta aggregation. The landed controller fixes:

- one lawful prefix-decodable canonical statement preimage derived from the Lean descriptor,
  rounds, padding, public values, and cube encoding—never caller-authored statement bytes;
- lawful receipt/field/message codecs;
- cSHAKE-derived gamma, round challenges, and eta;
- exact transcript order; and
- the full algebraic acceptance relation around arbitrary native bytes/error.

The admission theorem names gate algebra, gate PCS, subfield, proximity, binding, oracle transport,
challenge sampling, and final LDT as eight events on one finite coin. Challenge sampling is
separate because radix-`BabyBear` reduction of cSHAKE bytes is not asserted uniform. Its reduction
laws are premises. Concrete PCS, subfield proof, proximity, binding/ROM, sampling-bias price, final
LDT, global-game injection, recursion, and deployed 137-bit security remain.

### Semantic history and BCS game

The retained history now supplies exact genesis/chain/link words and challenges, accumulator/fold/
source alignment, semantic-to-finite claim/witness reindexing, roots/opened-column binding, and the
actual unshifted semantic BCS reduction. PCS, commitment-binding, and ROM `Good` events share one
history coin; private admission has only an `ofNotBad` constructor.

`SemanticHistoryTower256CheckpointGame` now joins the history and Tower256 additive predicates on
one `Omega`, one existing `FailureLedger`, exact WARP-terminal/additive-initial root and schedule
equalities, and one four-event union bound without independence. This closes the former structural
“two ledgers” residual at that exact boundary.

It remains a conditional **P shape**, not the premises themselves. `JointGameFamily` takes the
externally selected BCS false-accept predicate and history reduction cover as fields and reuses the
additive family's cover; MCA and RS `codeExact` remain premises. Concrete PCS opening, CR/binding,
ROM transport, hiding/sub-UD, and those cover instantiations remain.

## Semantic and deployment joins

Loom's proof claims meet the semantic kernel only through typed clauses:

- exact requests and family-selected argument bytes are bound to accepted effects;
- canonical patches produce one pre/post state and exact footprint;
- flat multi-cell hyperedges publish joint effects;
- exact-head history admission binds a precise entry, occurrence, receipt root, and supported
  finite post layout; and
- durable settlement has a semantic model but still needs physical implementation refinement.

The deployment registry is fail-closed: base V1 contains zero dialect clauses; 406 has deterministic
control but no native byte profile; 404 is gated; BFV 901 is reserved with zero proof-suite and
controller pins. A manifest record never supplies cryptographic evidence.

## Native compute boundary

The canonical artifact authenticates native ABI codecs and a native work catalog. The current
generated catalog contains Tower256 dot product work `9101`, carrier `205`, request codec `9001`,
and response codec `21`. This closes artifact identity and transport selection.

Rust remains opaque and fallible. There is no Rust operational semantics, Lean↔Rust refinement,
FFI proof, or cross-language correctness theorem. Deleted reference prover/verifier, WGPU, sampled
FRI/OOD, Ext6 verifier, and LogUp verifier paths remain historical and must not be cited as current
runtime closure.

## Performance boundary — B, narrow

Source `54295c6` and evidence `4d1f290` validate byte identity and measure direct versus generated
dispatch for work 9101. Ratios across lengths 1–16384 were `0.985–1.040` on hbox and
`0.985–1.025` on persvati. This is an empirical dispatch microbenchmark with no threshold and no
semantic, security, or complete-prover implication.

## Historical claim corrections

- “The recursive verifier is complete” meant a then-local emittable AIR gadget composition. It did
  not include real CR/ROM, complete root/opening/domain wiring, recursive control, or deployment.
- “The v0 soundness tower is proved” meant an ideal uniform-schedule theorem composition at its
  interfaces. It was not a concrete one-game proof system.
- “Fully native NIZK” meant the formal reduction's own message/relation resolution, not Rust and not
  a deployed NIZK.
- “Deployed BCS alphabet” meant a concrete formal message shape, not a deployed PCS/controller.
- Old BabyBear⁴ prover, FRI, reference verifier, and WGPU results describe deleted experiments.

The theorems and counterexamples remain useful historical evidence. Their old deployment rhetoric
is superseded.

## What remains before a defensible whole

1. Instantiate the landed same-coin history/additive cover with the actual BCS predicate, reduction
   cover, MCA, and RS code-exactness.
2. Instantiate PositionBinding/CR, cSHAKE→ROM, proximity/PCS, hiding, and sampled-decider reductions
   at the actual controller parameters.
3. Complete versioned proof/container/domain codecs and authenticated native work profiles.
4. Close Ext6 PCS/subfield/proximity/final-LDT and global-game joins.
5. Close a concrete BFV proof controller and separately authorized disclosure path.
6. Deploy one durable handler and migrate real user/agent consumers.
7. Benchmark admitted end-to-end workloads against alternatives and apply Loom's kill criteria.

The defensible one-breath claim is:

> minidregg has a large machine-checked proof-system and semantic core, exact Lean-owned additive,
> lookup, Ext6, and history control seams, and an authenticated bytes/error native boundary. The
> remaining work is to close their concrete cryptographic games, deployment handlers, consumer
> migrations, and matched end-to-end performance without weakening those boundaries.
